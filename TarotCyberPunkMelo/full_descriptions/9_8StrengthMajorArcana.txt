**Strength** is the eighth card in the Major Arcana of the Tarot, symbolizing courage, inner strength, and the power of compassion and love. Unlike the forceful energy of The Chariot, which represents outward control and willpower, Strength speaks to the inner fortitude that comes from patience, gentle influence, and the mastery of one’s emotions and instincts. It is a card that emphasizes the power of soft control, where true strength is derived from understanding, kindness, and the ability to remain calm and composed in the face of challenges.

### Symbolism and Imagery

The imagery of the Strength card is rich with symbolism that reflects its themes of inner power, courage, and the gentle taming of primal forces. The card typically features a woman calmly taming or interacting with a lion, a scene that encapsulates the essence of strength through compassion rather than force.

- **The Woman**: The central figure in the Strength card is a woman, often depicted as serene and gentle. She is usually shown calmly closing the mouth of a lion or caressing it, symbolizing her ability to tame and control the beast not through brute force, but through her calm, composed demeanor and inner strength. The woman represents the higher self, the conscious mind that has mastered its lower, more animalistic instincts. She embodies qualities such as patience, compassion, and gentle persuasion.

- **The Lion**: The lion in the Strength card is a powerful symbol of raw, primal energy, representing our base instincts, passions, and desires. In many interpretations, the lion stands for the more unruly aspects of the human psyche—anger, fear, and aggression—that must be tamed and integrated into the conscious self. The lion’s presence alongside the woman illustrates the balance between the conscious mind and the instinctual forces within us. The fact that the woman can tame the lion without using force shows that true strength comes from within, from understanding and mastering these primal urges.

- **The Infinity Symbol (Lemniscate)**: Above the woman’s head, there is often an infinity symbol, also known as the lemniscate. This symbol represents the infinite potential of the human spirit and the eternal nature of the soul. It suggests that the woman’s strength is not just physical or temporary, but spiritual and enduring. The infinity symbol also indicates the continuous flow of energy between the conscious mind and the primal instincts, emphasizing the need for balance and harmony between these forces.

- **The Floral Garland or Crown**: The woman is often depicted wearing a garland of flowers or a crown, symbolizing purity, innocence, and the natural world. The floral imagery reinforces the idea that strength is connected to nature and that true power is aligned with the natural order. The garland or crown also represents victory and achievement, indicating that the woman has successfully tamed the lion and mastered her inner forces.

- **The Landscape**: The background of the Strength card typically features a calm, natural setting, such as a lush garden or a serene field. This peaceful landscape contrasts with the wild energy of the lion, highlighting the theme of harmony between nature and the human spirit. The setting also emphasizes the card’s message of finding strength in peace and tranquility, rather than in conflict or aggression.

The reversed Strength card encourages the querent to find ways to manage their emotions and to avoid acting out of anger or frustration.

- **Resistance to Change**: The reversed Strength card may indicate resistance to change or a fear of confronting difficult emotions.

The reversed Strength card encourages the querent to release their fears and to move forward with confidence and determination.

- **Overwhelming Emotions**: When Strength is reversed, it can also signify that the querent is being overwhelmed by their emotions, struggling to maintain balance or control.

Here is the Tarot card image for "8 Strength" inspired by sacred geometry. The design incorporates the infinity symbol and geometric patterns like the Flower of Life, emphasizing the card's themes of inner strength, balance, and harmony. The sacred geometry elements are naturally integrated into the traditional Tarot imagery, enhancing the symbolism of resilience, grace, and the connection between human and animal instincts.

Lust Upright Meaning
The Strength Tarot card represents nature, which, however wild in its primal form, is tamed by our subtler, finer self -- our feminine side, our inner self. The will and passion of our instinctive nature does not need to be broken, but refined and brought to consciousness, so that all levels of creation may come into harmony.
The feminine soul-force contains a persuasive power that can nurture and induce cooperation from others, stilling disruptive energies by harmonizing differences in the spirit of collective good will.
Lust Reversed Meaning
The Strength card reversed suggests that you are in a position where you have little power to affect behavior. No amount of modeling, persuasion or leadership will affect the out-of-control, untamed force that is set loose.
Subtleties are overlooked, and the inducements which have served in the past to reward order may meet with scorn. You may have to lay low and do what you can to preserve yourself, and let this upside down time blow over.
Lust Advice Position
The Strength card advises that you assertively discipline yourself and separate self interest from enlightened wisdom. Deliberately identify with your intuition, even if it works against the desires of your willful ego.
Demand and expect the same from others who have some power in this situation. You cannot challenge them to live to a higher standard if you, yourself, have not yet done so. Influence others by setting an example of integrity. Your self-esteem will increase to the degree that you succeed in your efforts.
Lust Love Position
The Strength card in this position compliments your ability to sublimate emotionality, impulsiveness, and instinctive urges. This is a taming force, which raises behavior standards and models higher levels of composure, grounding and centering -- even with a possible romantic partner.
In this card's traditional image, a female figure with a lion shows the power of intuition at work -- a subtle sensual, telepathic ability that can transmit nonverbal signals and evoke an appropriate response. Strength signifies a superior energy that neutralizes conflict and ushers in harmony and cooperation.
Lust Career Position
The Strength card suggests it may be necessary that the person who is the far seeing harmonizing force among you be the one to provide the direction right now. With all due respect to the parties involved, this person will be more likely to address the conflicts in the workplace and evenhandedly point out the greater good, without their own personal agenda getting in the way. The ability to do this for oneself is a mark of maturity. The ability to help others in this way is a gift.
There is not room right now for mad passions, temper, rivalries or even ambient disgruntlement. The situation at work calls out for an individual who can bridge the gap between different kinds of consciousness. All instinctive and egotistical motives must be transformed into a broader view. If you are not personally the taming force portrayed on this card, then at least do not resist the one who is!

Lust in a Yes or No Card Reading
Strength is a card of vulnerability and courage. If you're looking for simple Yes or No guidance and receive Strength, the answer is YES. Speak from the heart and trust others to meet you with support.

Here is where you’ll be able to find your power; this card signals that you likely already have the talent and the skill, you only need to muster your courage to make big moves.

Reversed Strength Meaning
An upside down Strength card can mean that you are (or about to) experience an intense anger or fear in your life.

Being full individuals with your own lives brings more to your partnership; it doesn’t detract from it. Make sure that there is a strong sense of trust in your partnership. A reversed Strength tarot love meaning can also indicate that force and power are becoming more apparent themes in your relationship. One partner may be becoming more and more domineering, instead of empathic and understanding. You may have to make sure that one partner’s needs aren’t being trampled over in favor of another’s.

The Strength card, the eighth card in the Tarot’s Major Arcana, is a profound symbol of inner power, courage, compassion, and the mastery of the self. It typically depicts a woman gently holding or taming a lion, symbolizing the harmonious control of one's primal instincts through calmness and inner strength rather than brute force. When viewed through the lens of Sacred Geometry, the symbolism of the Strength card reveals deep connections to the infinite potential of the soul, the harmonious balance of opposing forces, and the alchemical fusion of spirit and matter. Here’s an in-depth exploration of how Sacred Geometry applies to the Strength card:

### 1. **The Number 8 (Symbol of Infinity, Balance, and Transformation)**
   - **Infinity and Eternal Flow**: The number 8 is most commonly associated with the infinity symbol (∞), which represents the concept of endless cycles, eternal flow, and the balance of opposites. In the Strength card, the number 8 reflects the infinite nature of inner strength and the perpetual cycle of growth and transformation that comes from mastering one's instincts. The lemniscate (infinity symbol) often found above the figure’s head in the card is a direct representation of this concept, highlighting the continuous flow of energy and power within the individual.
   - **Balance and Harmony**: The number 8 is also a symbol of balance and symmetry, which is crucial to the Strength card. The card teaches that true power comes from balancing the primal and the refined, the instinctual and the intellectual, the physical and the spiritual. In Sacred Geometry, the symmetry of the number 8 reflects the harmonious integration of these dual aspects, leading to a state of equilibrium and strength.

### 2. **The Lemniscate (Infinity Symbol)**
   - **The Lemniscate as a Symbol of Infinite Potential**: The lemniscate, or infinity symbol (∞), is a fundamental shape in Sacred Geometry, representing the infinite and eternal nature of existence. In the Strength card, the lemniscate symbolizes the infinite potential of the human spirit and the boundless nature of inner strength. The figure in the card, often depicted with the lemniscate above her head, embodies the idea that strength comes from tapping into this infinite source of energy and power within oneself.
   - **Flow and Continuity**: The lemniscate also represents the continuous flow of energy and the cyclical nature of life. In the context of the Strength card, it emphasizes that strength is not static but dynamic, requiring continuous balance and harmony between opposing forces. The infinity symbol underscores the idea that inner strength is a perpetual process of growth and transformation, where each challenge faced and overcome adds to the reservoir of personal power.

### 3. **The Vesica Piscis (Symbol of Duality and Integration)**
   - **The Vesica Piscis and the Union of Opposites**: The Vesica Piscis, formed by the intersection of two circles, is a powerful symbol in Sacred Geometry that represents the union of opposites and the creation of new realities. In the Strength card, this symbol can be seen in the harmonious relationship between the woman and the lion—representing the integration of the conscious and subconscious, the rational and the instinctual. The Vesica Piscis reflects the idea that true strength comes from the balanced integration of these dualities, leading to a state of inner peace and mastery.
   - **Creation and Birth of Strength**: The Vesica Piscis is also a symbol of creation and birth, emphasizing that strength is not something that is forced but something that is cultivated and developed through the integration of all aspects of the self. In the Strength card, this symbol highlights the idea that inner power is born from the union of seemingly opposing forces, creating a new and harmonious whole.

### 4. **The Triangle (Symbol of Aspiration, Spiritual Growth, and Harmony)**
   - **The Triangle of Aspiration and Harmony**: The triangle, particularly when pointing upwards, is a symbol of aspiration, spiritual growth, and the integration of body, mind, and spirit. In the Strength card, the triangle can represent the aspirational journey of mastering one’s inner nature and achieving harmony between different aspects of the self. The triangle’s stability and balance reflect the idea that true strength comes from the alignment of physical, emotional, and spiritual energies.
   - **Threefold Integration**: The triangle’s three sides represent the integration of the three aspects of existence—physical (the lion), emotional (the woman’s gentle touch), and spiritual (the lemniscate above her head). In the Strength card, this integration is key to developing inner strength, where the individual is in harmony with their instincts, emotions, and higher consciousness.

### 5. **The Circle (Symbol of Unity, Wholeness, and Inner Power)**
   - **The Circle of Inner Power**: The circle, representing unity, wholeness, and eternity, is a fundamental symbol in Sacred Geometry. In the Strength card, the circle can symbolize the complete and unified nature of inner strength, where all aspects of the self are brought into harmony. The card teaches that true power comes from being whole and centered within oneself, where the circle represents the continuous and unbroken flow of energy and strength within.
   - **Wholeness and Inner Peace**: The circle also symbolizes the idea that inner strength is achieved through the wholeness of being, where the individual is at peace with both their higher self and their primal instincts. The Strength card reflects the idea that this wholeness is the source of true power, where the individual is in perfect harmony with all aspects of their existence.

### 6. **The Hexagon (Symbol of Balance, Harmony, and Strength in Structure)**
   - **Hexagon as a Symbol of Balance and Harmony**: The hexagon, with its six sides, represents balance, harmony, and the efficient structuring of energy in Sacred Geometry. In the Strength card, the hexagon symbolizes the balanced and harmonious nature of true strength, where the individual has mastered the art of integrating opposing forces within themselves. The Strength card teaches that power is not about domination but about maintaining a balanced and harmonious state of being.
   - **Strength in Structure**: The hexagon is also a symbol of strength in structure, emphasizing that true power comes from a strong and balanced foundation. In the Strength card, this foundation is the individual’s inner harmony, where the balanced integration of the physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects of the self creates a strong and resilient inner structure.

### 7. **The Spiral (Symbol of Growth, Evolution, and the Continuous Journey of Strength)**
   - **The Spiral of Continuous Growth**: The spiral, a fundamental symbol in Sacred Geometry, represents evolution, growth, and the cyclical nature of existence. In the Strength card, the spiral symbolizes the continuous journey of developing and evolving one’s inner strength. The Strength card teaches that true power is not something that is static but something that is constantly growing and evolving through life’s challenges and experiences.
   - **Dynamic Balance in the Journey of Strength**: The spiral also represents the dynamic balance of energy, where the individual must continuously adapt and grow in response to life’s challenges. In the Strength card, this dynamic balance is key to maintaining inner strength, where the individual’s power grows stronger with each turn of the spiral, leading to greater resilience and mastery over time.

### 8. **The Flower of Life (Symbol of Interconnectedness, Unity, and the Blueprint of Strength)**
   - **The Flower of Life as the Blueprint of Inner Strength**: The Flower of Life, a complex geometric pattern composed of overlapping circles, symbolizes the interconnectedness of all life and the underlying blueprint of existence. In the Strength card, the Flower of Life represents the idea that inner strength is part of the universal pattern of life, where all aspects of existence are interconnected and contribute to the individual’s power. The Strength card teaches that true power comes from recognizing and embracing this interconnectedness, where the individual is in harmony with the greater whole.
   - **Unity Through Inner Strength**: The Flower of Life also symbolizes unity, where the individual’s inner strength is connected to the greater cosmic order. In the Strength card, this unity is achieved through the harmonious integration of all aspects of the self, where the individual’s power is not isolated but part of the universal flow of energy. The Flower of Life’s intricate design reflects the complexity and beauty of true strength, where the individual’s power is a reflection of the greater whole.

### 9. **The Mandala (Symbol of Wholeness, Cosmic Order, and the Centering of Strength)**
   - **The Mandala of Centered Strength**: The mandala, a complex geometric design that represents the universe and cosmic order, is a symbol of wholeness, unity, and the centering of energy. In the Strength card, the mandala represents the idea that true strength comes from being centered and grounded within oneself, where all aspects of the self are brought into harmony and balance. The Strength card teaches that power is not about external force but about inner peace and centeredness, where the individual’s strength is a reflection of their alignment with the cosmic order.
   - **Wholeness Through Inner Strength**: The mandala’s circular shape emphasizes the idea that true strength comes from recognizing and embracing the interconnectedness of all things, where the individual is both a part of the whole and a reflection of the divine. In the Strength card, this wholeness is achieved through the integration of the physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects of the self, where the individual’s power is a reflection of their inner harmony and unity with the universe.

### 10. **The Torus (Symbol of Continuous Flow, Energy, and the Self-Sustaining Nature of Strength)**
   - **The Torus of Self-Sustaining Strength**: The torus is a geometric shape that represents the concept of flow, energy, and continuous cycles. In the Strength card, the torus symbolizes the self-sustaining nature of true power, where the individual’s inner strength is constantly renewed and sustained through the continuous flow of energy within themselves. The Strength card teaches that power is not something that can be depleted but something that is continuously regenerated and sustained through the balance of opposing forces.
   - **Continuous Renewal of Inner Power**: The torus also represents the idea that true strength comes from the continuous renewal of energy, where the individual’s power is constantly growing and evolving through life’s experiences.
