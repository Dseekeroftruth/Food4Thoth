**Temperance** is the 14th card in the Major Arcana of the Tarot deck and represents the themes of balance, moderation, and harmony. It embodies the concept of blending different elements to create something new and harmonious, signifying the importance of patience, self-control, and the ability to adapt to situations in a balanced manner. Temperance is often seen as the mediator between opposites, guiding them into a state of equilibrium.

### Symbolism and Imagery

The Temperance card is rich with symbolism, each element contributing to its broader meanings.

- **The Angel**: At the center of the Temperance card is usually a large, serene angel, often depicted as being androgynous, representing a balance between male and female energies. This angel is often shown with large wings, symbolizing the ability to transcend earthly concerns and to see situations from a higher, more spiritual perspective. The angel's calm demeanor conveys peace, tranquility, and the steady hand needed to blend opposites.

- **The Two Cups**: The angel is typically depicted pouring water between two cups, representing the blending of different elements—usually interpreted as the conscious and subconscious minds, or the physical and spiritual realms. The act of pouring water between the cups without spilling a drop signifies precision, balance, and the careful blending of opposites. It also suggests the idea of flow, the seamless transfer of energy from one state to another.

- **One Foot on Land, One in Water**: The angel is often shown with one foot on land and one in water, symbolizing the need to balance the material world (land) with the emotional or spiritual world (water). This stance reflects the importance of maintaining equilibrium between different aspects of life—between thought and emotion, action and reflection, the material and the spiritual.

- **The Triangle on the Robe**: The angel’s robe often features a triangle within a square, symbolizing the union of the spirit (the triangle) with the material world (the square). This represents the integration of higher spiritual principles into everyday life, emphasizing the need to bring harmony and balance to all aspects of existence.

- **The Sun and Path in the Background**: In the background, a winding path leads toward mountains with a bright sun rising or setting behind them. The path represents the journey of life, with its twists and turns, leading ultimately to enlightenment (symbolized by the sun). The mountains suggest the challenges and aspirations that lie ahead, while the sun signifies clarity, purpose, and the ultimate goal of spiritual ascension.

- **The Iris Flowers**: Sometimes, the card features iris flowers, symbolizing faith, wisdom, and the communication between the divine and the earthly realms. The flowers also add a touch of nature and growth, reinforcing the idea that balance and harmony lead to flourishing and abundance.

- **The Rainbow**: In some depictions, a rainbow appears, symbolizing hope, divine promise, and the bridging of different realms. The rainbow connects the heavens and the earth, much like Temperance seeks to bring together and harmonize opposing forces.

### Interpretation and Meaning

Temperance is a card that calls for moderation, balance, and patience. It encourages a thoughtful, measured approach to life, where different aspects are harmonized and extremes are avoided. The card is a reminder to stay centered and to maintain equilibrium in all areas of life.

#### Key Themes:

1. **Balance and Harmony**:
   - Temperance is first and foremost a card of balance. It signifies the need to find the middle ground, to avoid extremes, and to create harmony by blending different elements. This could be balancing work and play, managing emotions with logic, or integrating spiritual practices into daily life. The card encourages a state of equilibrium where all aspects of life are in sync.

2. **Moderation and Self-Control**:
   - The concept of moderation is central to Temperance. The card suggests that the querent may need to exercise restraint and avoid excess. This could mean moderating one’s behavior, emotions, or impulses to maintain a sense of inner peace and stability. It’s about finding the right proportions, whether it’s in relationships, health, or work, to ensure that nothing is overindulged or neglected.

3. **Integration and Synthesis**:
   - Temperance also represents the process of integration, where different elements or aspects of life are brought together to form a cohesive whole. This could be the integration of different aspects of the self, such as merging rational thought with emotional wisdom, or combining different ideas or perspectives to create something new and innovative. The card encourages the synthesis of diverse influences to create harmony and understanding.

4. **Adaptability and Flexibility**:
   - The ability to adapt and remain flexible is another key aspect of Temperance. The card suggests that the querent may need to go with the flow and adjust their approach as circumstances change. It’s about being fluid, like the water being poured between the cups, and finding ways to navigate life’s challenges without becoming rigid or resistant.

5. **Patience and Timing**:
   - Temperance emphasizes the importance of patience and the recognition that everything has its time. It suggests that the querent may need to wait for the right moment to act, or to allow a situation to unfold naturally rather than forcing it. This patience is crucial for maintaining balance and for ensuring that actions are taken at the most opportune time.

6. **Spiritual and Emotional Equilibrium**:
   - On a deeper level, Temperance speaks to the need for spiritual and emotional balance. It encourages the querent to seek inner peace and to cultivate a sense of calm amidst the chaos of life. The card suggests that spiritual practices, meditation, or mindfulness could be beneficial in maintaining this equilibrium and in connecting with a higher state of consciousness.

### Temperance in Different Contexts

- **In Career**: When Temperance appears in a career reading, it suggests the need for balance and moderation in work life. It may indicate a time to find a better work-life balance, to avoid burnout, or to take a more measured approach to professional challenges. The card encourages patience, suggesting that steady progress is more effective than rushing ahead. It may also indicate a career that involves mediation, counseling, or roles that require a balanced and harmonious approach.

- **In Relationships**: In the context of relationships, Temperance signifies the need for harmony and mutual understanding. It suggests that the querent should strive to balance their own needs with the needs of their partner and to avoid extremes in emotions or behavior. The card encourages open communication, compromise, and the blending of different perspectives to create a harmonious relationship. It may also indicate the healing of past conflicts and the restoration of balance in a relationship.

- **In Personal Development**: Temperance is a powerful card for personal growth, indicating a period of introspection and the quest for inner balance. It suggests that the querent is on a path of self-discovery, seeking to harmonize different aspects of their personality or life.

The card may also indicate recovery and healing, emphasizing the importance of patience and taking things one step at a time.

### Reversed Temperance

When Temperance appears reversed, its meanings can shift to indicate imbalance, excess, or a lack of harmony.

- **Imbalance and Extremes**: Reversed, Temperance suggests that the querent may be experiencing imbalance in their life. This could manifest as extremes in behavior, emotions, or circumstances. The card indicates a need to reassess and find ways to restore balance, to avoid the negative consequences of living in extremes.

- **Lack of Moderation**: The reversed Temperance card often points to a lack of moderation, where the querent may be overindulging in certain aspects of life or neglecting others. It could indicate impulsive actions, overindulgence in food, alcohol, or other substances, or an inability to find a middle ground in situations. The card advises the querent to regain control and to seek a more balanced approach.

- **Inflexibility and Rigidity**: When reversed, Temperance can suggest a lack of flexibility or an unwillingness to adapt to changing circumstances. The querent may be resisting the flow of life, holding onto rigid beliefs or behaviors that prevent them from achieving harmony. The card encourages the querent to be more open to change and to find ways to adapt and go with the flow.

- **Impulsiveness and Haste**: The reversed Temperance card can also indicate impulsiveness and a tendency to rush into situations without careful consideration. It suggests that the querent may need to slow down, think things through, and take a more measured approach to avoid potential pitfalls.

### Conclusion

Temperance is a card that embodies the principles of balance, moderation, and harmony. It teaches the importance of integrating different aspects of life, finding the middle ground, and approaching situations with patience and adaptability. Whether in relationships, career, or personal growth, Temperance encourages a thoughtful, measured approach that leads to lasting peace and fulfillment. When reversed, it serves as a reminder to reassess and restore balance, to avoid the negative consequences of living in extremes. In all contexts, Temperance is a guiding force towards equilibrium, inner peace, and the harmonious blending of life’s diverse elements.

14. Temperance (XIV)

	•	Sacred Geometry: Hexagram (Star of David)
	•	Description: Temperance represents balance, moderation, and harmony. The hexagram, made up of two interlocking triangles (one pointing up, one down), symbolizes the balance of opposites and the unity of spirit and matter.

The design includes a hexagram, symbolizing the blending of opposites, and the Flower of Life, integrated into the background to emphasize balance and harmony. The soft and balanced colors create a serene atmosphere, aligning with the themes of moderation and spiritual equilibrium in the Temperance card.

Art Upright Meaning
The Temperance card is a reference to the soul. Classically female, the woman or angel on the Temperance card is mixing up a blend of subtle energies for the evolution of the personality. One key to interpreting this card can be found in its title -- a play on the process of tempering metals in a forge.
Metals must undergo extremes of temperature, folding, and pounding, but the end product is infinitely superior to impure ore mined from the earth. In this image, the soul volunteers the ego for a cleansing and healing experience, which may turn the personality inside-out, but which brings out the gold hidden within the heart.

Art Reversed Meaning
The Temperance card reversed suggests that you are in danger of giving up on yourself. Something is making you feel apathetic and ignore what you deeply want and need.
You may be morbidly overemphasizing the chaos and disruption that would come with change and growth rather than focusing on the regeneration and liberation that could be yours. Try to carve out a day in which you do only activities that make you happy. Eat well and get some rest, then take another look at your life. If you do not gain a better perspective, seek help.
Art Advice Position
The Temperance card advises you to identify and seek the missing ingredients in your life. Marshal your known skills and abilities and do what needs to be done to complete your mission.
Prepare to use spiritual practices, studies, or lifestyle changes that can assist you in your quest. A tremendous amount of benefit is available if you can organize yourself and be disciplined at this time.
Art Love Position
With Temperance in this position, you are ready to take responsibility for getting well, no matter what it takes. The quest for health could be on a physical, emotional or mental level, or it may have to do with paying off "karmic dues."
In any case, the work is to clear up past dysfunction and address entangled emotions in your potential relationship. The process will purge the toxic waste of unfinished business with your future partner that disables you. When you are ready, mix your powerful medicine. This is the right time to start healing yourself.
Art Career Position
An energy of harmony has been called in and the remedy for the faulty functioning is being sought. Corporate white blood cells are being dispatched to mend the breech. This is a chance to let go of old roles and timeworn projections. You and your coworkers needed conditions on the job to change and now they are.
Do not give up now by thinking that this situation is beyond salvaging. There is something that you are learning by staying aboard and assisting with the turnaround. Sometimes the remedy is in going through the process, rather than attaining or failing to attain any given outcome.

Art in a Yes or No Card Reading
Temperance is a card of unseen support. If you're looking for simple Yes or No guidance and receive Temperance, the answer is NO. Take a break and allow yourself a moment to breathe.

You may benefit from being a bit more patient, while also making sure that your own emotions or desires do not go into extremes. When your date does something that is displeasing to you, do you tend to immediately reject them? Are you too demanding on your potential partners, so that nobody ever can satisfy you?

Something at work may be suffering from a lack of balance right now. Do you tend to go all in when it comes to your work, so much so that other aspects of your life suffer? Are you always pulling all-nighters, hoping that it all pays off in the end? Or alternatively, do you find that you slack off, leading to resentment from your colleagues? While the former can bring you success, this can be damaging to you in the long term. If this applies to you, look to correct this imbalance. Ensure that when completing projects, you aren’t rushing through them or making reckless choices; the quality of your work may be suffering.

Reversed Finances Meaning

failure to balance long term needs with short term happiness

Finances Meaning - Reversed Temperance
Are you someone who always needs to buy yourself the next nice luxury? Or alternatively are you so frugal that you never reward your hard efforts with any small treat? It’s likely that both of these attitudes will need adjustment, as they are both untenable in the long term. The first always puts instant gratification over your future comfort, and vice versa. Consider your financial goals, and make sure you also put your own well-being in the picture; both your future well-being, and your present well-being needs to find a comfortable middle ground.

Temperance, the fourteenth card in the Tarot’s Major Arcana, symbolizes balance, moderation, harmony, and the blending of opposites. It is a card that represents the alchemical process of transforming and refining energies to achieve equilibrium and higher understanding. The imagery typically features an angelic figure mixing liquids between two vessels, symbolizing the blending of different elements or forces. Through the lens of Sacred Geometry, the symbolism of Temperance becomes a profound exploration of balance, integration, and the harmonious interplay of dualities within the cosmic order. Here’s an in-depth exploration of how Sacred Geometry applies to the Temperance card:

### 1. **The Number 14 (Symbol of Balance and Duality)**
   - **The Duality in 14**: The number 14 can be seen as the integration of the numbers 1 and 4, which when added (1+4) result in 5—a number representing change and transformation. The number 14 symbolizes the harmonious blending of dualities, where the number 1 represents unity and initiation, and the number 4 represents structure, stability, and the material world. In the context of the Temperance card, the number 14 reflects the process of achieving balance through the careful and deliberate blending of different forces. The number also hints at the idea that balance is dynamic and requires continuous adjustment and refinement.
   - **The Tetrad and Unity**: In Pythagorean numerology, 14 reduces to 5, which can be seen as the pentad, representing the five elements and the human experience. The process of Temperance involves refining these elements and bringing them into balance, highlighting the idea that moderation and equilibrium lead to harmony in both the physical and spiritual realms.

### 2. **The Vesica Piscis (Symbol of Union and Balance)**
   - **Harmonious Blending**: The Vesica Piscis, formed by the intersection of two circles, is a powerful symbol in Sacred Geometry representing the union of dualities and the creation of new realities through their integration. In the Temperance card, the Vesica Piscis can be seen in the imagery of the angel mixing the contents of two cups, symbolizing the alchemical process of blending different elements to create balance. The Vesica Piscis emphasizes the idea that true harmony is achieved when opposing forces are brought together in a balanced and integrated way, resulting in the creation of something greater than the sum of its parts.
   - **Sacred Space of Transformation**: The Vesica Piscis also represents a sacred space or the "womb" of creation, where transformation occurs. In Temperance, this space symbolizes the internal process of refinement and transformation, where the blending of different energies leads to spiritual growth and enlightenment. The Vesica Piscis, as a gateway between worlds, reflects the process of temperance as a bridge between the material and spiritual realms, where balance and moderation are key to achieving higher states of consciousness.

### 3. **The Triangle (Symbol of Balance, Harmony, and Integration)**
   - **The Triangle of Equilibrium**: The equilateral triangle, with its three equal sides, is a symbol of balance, harmony, and integration. In the context of Temperance, the triangle represents the balance between mind, body, and spirit, as well as the balance between opposing forces such as light and dark, masculine and feminine, or spiritual and material. The triangle’s perfect symmetry reflects the ideal of Temperance, where each aspect of the self is harmonized and brought into alignment with the others. The process of temperance involves finding this balance, where all elements are integrated into a cohesive whole.
   - **The Alchemical Triangle**: The triangle is also a symbol of alchemical processes, where it represents the transformative process of combining elements to achieve a higher state of purity and perfection. In Temperance, the triangle symbolizes the process of spiritual alchemy, where the blending of different energies leads to the creation of something new and refined. The triangle’s connection to the element of fire reflects the transformative nature of this process, where the heat of alchemical fire is used to purify and refine the elements being blended.

### 4. **The Circle (Symbol of Unity, Wholeness, and Continuous Flow)**
   - **The Circle of Harmony**: The circle, representing unity, wholeness, and eternity, is a fundamental symbol in Sacred Geometry. In Temperance, the circle symbolizes the continuous flow of energy and the idea that balance is not static but dynamic and constantly evolving. The angel’s actions of pouring liquid between two vessels can be seen as a representation of the circular flow of energy, where the blending of opposites creates a harmonious and balanced whole. The circle’s unbroken line emphasizes the idea that true balance is an ongoing process, where the forces at play are in a constant state of flux and must be continuously adjusted to maintain harmony.
   - **Wholeness Through Integration**: The circle also symbolizes wholeness, where the process of temperance leads to a state of completeness and integration. In Temperance, this wholeness is achieved through the deliberate and mindful blending of different aspects of the self, where each part is brought into harmony with the others. The circle’s symbolism of unity emphasizes the idea that true balance involves the integration of all aspects of existence, where each part is recognized and valued as an essential component of the whole.

### 5. **The Square (Symbol of Stability, Structure, and Foundation)**
   - **The Square of Stability**: The square, with its four equal sides, is a symbol of stability, structure, and the material world. In the context of Temperance, the square represents the foundation upon which balance and harmony are built. The square’s stability reflects the idea that true balance requires a solid and stable foundation, where all aspects of life are organized and structured in a way that promotes harmony. The square’s four sides can also represent the four elements (earth, air, fire, and water), which must be balanced and harmonized to achieve equilibrium in both the physical and spiritual realms.
   - **Law and Order**: The square is often associated with the concept of law and order, where its straight lines and right angles symbolize clarity, precision, and the adherence to natural laws. In Temperance, the square reflects the idea that balance is achieved through the careful and deliberate application of these laws, where each action is guided by an awareness of its impact on the greater whole. The square’s connection to the material world emphasizes the importance of grounding spiritual insights in practical application, where balance and moderation are essential for achieving harmony in daily life.

### 6. **The Hexagon and Hexagram (Symbol of Harmony, Integration, and Cosmic Order)**
   - **Hexagon as a Symbol of Balance and Harmony**: The hexagon, with its six sides, represents balance, harmony, and the efficient structuring of energy. In the context of Temperance, the hexagon symbolizes the balance between opposing forces and the integration of different elements into a harmonious whole. The hexagon’s connection to natural structures, such as honeycombs, reflects the idea that true balance is not imposed but emerges naturally when all aspects of life are brought into alignment. The hexagon’s symmetry emphasizes the importance of maintaining balance and harmony in all areas of life, where each part is integrated into a cohesive whole.
   - **Hexagram (Star of David)**: The hexagram, or Star of David, is formed by the interlocking of two equilateral triangles, symbolizing the union of opposites—spiritual and material, masculine and feminine, light and dark. In Temperance, the hexagram represents the integration of these dualities, where the blending of different forces creates a balanced and harmonious whole. The hexagram’s perfect symmetry reflects the idea that true temperance involves the integration of all aspects of existence, where each part is recognized as an essential component of the greater whole.

### 7. **The Spiral (Symbol of Evolution, Growth, and Dynamic Balance)**
   - **The Spiral of Dynamic Balance**: The spiral, a fundamental symbol in Sacred Geometry, represents evolution, growth, and the dynamic nature of balance. In the context of Temperance, the spiral symbolizes the ongoing process of balancing and refining the self, where each turn of the spiral represents a new phase in the journey toward harmony and equilibrium. The spiral’s connection to cycles and repetition reflects the idea that balance is not a static state but a dynamic process that requires continuous adjustment and refinement. The spiral’s continuous movement emphasizes the idea that true temperance involves embracing the natural flow of life, where each experience is an opportunity for growth and evolution.
   - **Growth Through Integration**: The spiral also represents the idea that true growth and evolution occur through the integration of different aspects of the self, where each experience is used as an opportunity to refine and balance the whole. In Temperance, the spiral’s symbolism emphasizes the importance of embracing change and allowing the natural flow of life to guide the process of temperance, where each phase of the journey leads to a deeper understanding of the self and the universe.

### 8. **The Flower of Life (Symbol of Interconnection, Unity, and the Blueprint of Existence)**
   - **The Flower of Life and the Blueprint of Harmony**: The Flower of Life, a complex geometric pattern composed of overlapping circles, symbolizes the interconnectedness of all life and the underlying blueprint of existence. In the context of Temperance, the Flower of Life represents the idea that balance and harmony are part of the natural order of existence, where each aspect of life is interconnected and interdependent. The process of temperance involves recognizing and embracing these connections, where the blending of different forces leads to a harmonious and balanced whole. The Flower of Life’s intricate design reflects the complexity of the forces that drive temperance, where each aspect of the self is integrated into a cohesive and harmonious whole.
   - **Unity Through Integration**: The Flower of Life also symbolizes unity and the idea that  true balance is achieved through the integration of all aspects of existence. In Temperance, this symbolism reflects the idea that harmony and balance are not achieved by isolating or suppressing different aspects of the self but by recognizing and embracing their interconnectedness. The Flower of Life’s perfect symmetry and balance emphasize the importance of finding harmony within oneself and the universe, where each part is recognized as an essential component of the greater whole.

### 9. **The Mandala (Symbol of Wholeness, Cosmic Order, and the Process of Integration)**
   - **The Mandala of Balance and Integration**: The mandala, a complex geometric design that represents the universe and cosmic order, is a symbol of wholeness, unity, and the process of integration. In Temperance, the mandala represents the process of bringing all aspects of the self into balance and harmony, where each part is integrated into a cohesive and harmonious whole. The mandala’s intricate patterns reflect the complexity of the forces that drive temperance, where the blending of different elements leads to a deeper understanding of the self and the universe. The mandala’s circular shape emphasizes the idea that true balance is not a static state but a dynamic process that requires continuous adjustment and refinement.
   - **Centering and Alignment Through Temperance**: The mandala’s central point represents the core of the self, where all aspects of the individual are unified and brought into balance. In Temperance, this symbolism reflects the idea that true harmony and balance are achieved through the process of centering and aligning with the cosmic order, where each aspect of the self is recognized and integrated into a cohesive whole. The mandala’s circular shape emphasizes the idea that the process of temperance is not linear but cyclical, where each phase of the journey leads to a deeper understanding of the self and the universe.

### 10. **The Torus (Symbol of Continuous Flow, Balance, and Integration)**
   - **The Torus of Dynamic Equilibrium**: The torus is a geometric shape that represents the concept of flow, energy, and continuous cycles. It is often depicted as a donut-shaped figure, where energy moves continuously in a self-sustaining loop. In the context of Temperance, the torus symbolizes the continuous flow of energy and the dynamic equilibrium that is achieved through the process of temperance. The torus’s shape reflects the idea that true balance is not a static state but a dynamic process that requires continuous adjustment and refinement. The process of temperance involves recognizing and embracing the natural flow of life, where the blending of different forces leads to a harmonious and balanced whole.
   - **Integration Through Flow**: The torus also represents the idea that true integration and balance are achieved through the continuous flow of energy, where each aspect of the self is recognized and integrated into a cohesive and harmonious whole. In Temperance, the torus’s symbolism emphasizes the importance of embracing change and allowing the natural flow of life to guide the process of temperance, where each experience is an opportunity for growth and evolution.

### Conclusion:
The Temperance card, when viewed through the lens of Sacred Geometry, is revealed as a profound symbol of balance, harmony, and the integration of opposites. The card is deeply connected to geometric principles such as the number 14, Vesica Piscis, triangle, circle, square, hexagon, spiral, Flower of Life, mandala, and torus. Each of these symbols reflects aspects of Temperance’s teachings—how true balance is achieved through the integration and harmonization of different forces, how the process of temperance is a dynamic and continuous journey, and how the blending of opposites leads to a higher state of unity and wholeness. Sacred Geometry reveals Temperance not just as a symbol of moderation and balance but as a powerful representation of the alchemical process that leads to spiritual growth, transformation, and the harmonious integration of all aspects of existence, guided by the underlying patterns and structures that govern the universe.
