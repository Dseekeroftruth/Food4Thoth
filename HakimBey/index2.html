                <h2>Who is Hakim Bey?</h2>
                <p>Hakim Bey, the pseudonym of Peter Lamborn Wilson, is a radical writer and philosopher known for his influential work on anarchism and the concept of the Temporary Autonomous Zone (TAZ). His ideas blend anarchist thought with mystical traditions, challenging conventional notions of society and freedom.</p>
                <div class="quote">
                    "The TAZ is like an uprising which does not engage directly with the State, a guerrilla operation which frees an area (of land, time, imagination) and then dissolves itself to reform elsewhere/elsewhen."

                <h3 id="taz">Temporary Autonomous Zones (TAZ)</h3>
                <p>The TAZ is a fleeting space where freedom reigns, free from external control. It's created through collective action, art, and the breaking of norms.</p>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>Key Aspects of TAZ:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ephemeral and spontaneous</li>
                        <li>Defies formal structures</li>

                <h3 id="immediatism">Immediatism</h3>
                <p>Immediatism is about engaging directly with experiences and people, stripping away the layers of mediation imposed by society. It's a call to live authentically and connect meaningfully.</p>

                <h3 id="poetic-action">Poetic Action</h3>
                <p>Poetic Action involves creating startling moments through art and actions that disrupt the ordinary, provoking thought and challenging perceptions without causing harm.</p>

                <p>Bey's concepts are not confined to theory; they resonate throughout history where communities have formed autonomous zones. Below is a comprehensive timeline:</p>
            
                <div class="timeline">
                    <h3>1. Prehistoric Societies</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Egalitarian Hunter-Gatherer Bands</h4>
                            <p>Prehistoric societies operated without formal hierarchies, making collective decisions and moving freely to avoid permanent power structures. 
                            Their mobility allowed them to maintain autonomy, avoiding permanent power structures.</p>

                            <p>Groups like the Scythians and Mongols maintained their autonomy by remaining mobile and resisting incorporation into sedentary empires. Their social structures reflect the principles of Temporary Autonomous Zones (TAZ).</p>

                        <li>

                            <p>Pirates in the Mediterranean and Caribbean created self-governed communities like the Salé Pirate Republic, embodying anarchistic principles and practicing direct democracy and shared resources.</p>

                        <li>

                <h2>Hakim Bey’s Contribution to Hashisheen: The End of Law</h2>
                <h3>Understanding the Role of an Anarchist Philosopher in an Esoteric Soundscape</h3>
                
                <div class="content">
                    <h4>Introduction:</h4>
                    <p>Hakim Bey plays a central intellectual role in <em>Hashisheen: The End of Law</em>, an album produced by Bill Laswell. This album delves into the mystical, historical, and philosophical aspects of the Hashshashin, also known as the Assassins, a secretive Nizari Ismaili sect led by Hassan-i Sabbah...</p>
                    
                    <h4>Hakim Bey’s Intellectual Role in the Album</h4>
                    <p>Hakim Bey’s contributions to <em>Hashisheen: The End of Law</em> are not limited to his spoken word performances; he is also credited as a key conceptual influence, helping to shape the album’s thematic direction...</p>
                    
                    <h4>Hakim Bey’s Spoken Word Performances:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>“Marco Polo’s Tale” (Track 5)</strong>
        <p>
            In this track, Hakim Bey delivers a vivid recounting of the Venetian explorer Marco Polo's alleged encounters with the legendary Assassins and their leader, Alauddin, known as "The Old Man of the Mountain." Through Bey's evocative narration and Nicky Skopelitis's rich, atmospheric composition, the track explores themes of cultural exchange, myth-making, the allure of paradise, and the manipulation of belief systems. The story intertwines historical accounts, philosophical musings, and imaginative storytelling, reflecting on the human longing for adventure, connection, and understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Lyrics Excerpt:</strong><br>
            <em>"This prince was called Alauddin, and was Mohammedan. He had created, in a lovely valley enclosed between two very high mountains, a very beautiful garden, full of every variety of fruit and trees that could be obtained..."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The track delves into the creation of illusion as a means of control, the exploitation of human desires, and the manipulation of faith for political ends. It also touches on the Western fascination with the East, highlighting how Marco Polo's exaggerated accounts contributed to the mythologization of the Assassins.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Musical Composition:</strong><br>
            Nicky Skopelitis's soundscape incorporates Eastern modal scales with Western instrumentation, using instruments like the oud, sitar, and guitar to evoke the mystique of Polo's journeys. Layers of ambient sounds and subtle percussion create an immersive environment, enhancing the storytelling and reflecting the narrative's shifts in tone and mood.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>“Pilgrimage to Cairo” (Track 6)</strong>
        <p>
            Hakim Bey's voice returns in "Pilgrimage to Cairo," a profound meditation on the human quest for enlightenment, framed through the historical and spiritual significance of Cairo. The track blends historical and philosophical reflections with poetic storytelling, capturing the essence of a spiritual journey. Cairo serves as a symbolic destination, representing enlightenment, cultural synthesis, and the timeless quest for divine truth.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Lyrics Excerpt:</strong><br>
            <em>"Then, one day, I reached those city gates where angels are servants, where planets and stars are slaves. A garden of roses and pines girded round with walls of emerald and jasper trees, set in a desert of gold-embroidered silk..."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Themes explored include the spiritual journey as both a physical and inner journey of self-discovery, mysticism and esotericism drawing on Sufi ideas, and cultural exchange reflecting Cairo's historical significance as a meeting point of diverse cultures and philosophies. The track encourages listeners to reflect on their own paths toward enlightenment.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Musical Composition:</strong><br>
            Bill Laswell uses ambient drones and Middle Eastern motifs to create a contemplative, immersive experience. Subtle percussive elements and modal scales evoke the sensory atmosphere of Cairo, enhancing the emotional and philosophical impact of Bey's narration.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>“The Assassins” (Track 21)</strong>
        <p>
            Perhaps the most significant track for understanding Hakim Bey's contribution to the album is "The Assassins," where Bey delivers a powerful spoken-word performance that immerses the listener in the enigmatic history of the Hashshashin. The track blends historical storytelling with philosophical introspection, bridging the gap between history, mysticism, and enduring themes of rebellion and autonomy.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Lyrics Excerpt:</strong><br>
            <em>"By night, Hassan-e-Saba, like a civilized wolf in a turban, stretches out on a parapet above the garden and glares at the sky, conning the asterisms of heresy in the mindless, cool, desert air..."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Bey's narration portrays Hassan-i Sabbah, the founder of the Hashshashin, as a figure contemplating rebellion against orthodoxy under the serene desert night. The lyrics delve into the mystique of the Assassins, highlighting the duality of risk and enlightenment within their philosophy. Themes such as the justification of violence for ideological ends, the interplay of fear, persuasion, and subversion, and the timeless quest for spiritual and political freedom are explored.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Musical Composition:</strong><br>
            Bill Laswell employs ethereal tones to create an ambient atmosphere that envelops the listener in a contemplative mood. The minimalistic instrumentation allows Bey's spoken word to remain the focal point, combining natural sounds with electronic effects to craft a timeless soundscape.
        </p>
        <p>
            "The Assassins" serves as a profound meditation on history, mysticism, and resistance, inviting listeners to engage with the Hashshashin's legacy and contemplate the complexities of autonomy, rebellion, and spiritual awakening. Through its layered storytelling and music, the track transcends its historical roots, resonating with universal themes of liberation and the human condition.
        </p>

    Fifth project by Bill Laswell for Sub Rosa, published in 1999.
    <br><br>
    <em>Hashisheen</em> is the result of two years of hard work and collaborations. This conceptual project, guided and supervised by Bill Laswell, is presented through voices and music from artists such as William S. Burroughs, Iggy Pop, Patti Smith, Jah Wobble, Paul Schütze, Techno Animal, Genesis P-Orridge, and many others.
    <br><br>
    A series of pieces about the ancient (11th century) and mystic story of Hasan bin Sabbah, Alamut—the "Garden of Earthly Delights"—and the rites of the Hashisheens (also called the "Assassins").
    <br><br>
    "The work of William S. Burroughs and collaborator Brian Gysin is the main inspiration and key to the initiation of The Hashisheen project," Bill Laswell explains. Their cut-up experiments influenced modern fiction, film, and contemporary collage music. Laswell delved deeply into North African and Arab culture, ritual magick, and the legendary story of Hasan-i Sabbah, whose libertarian doctrine declared: "Nothing Is True, Everything Is Permitted." 
    <br><br>
    The project brings together spoken word performances by iconic figures like Iggy Pop, William S. Burroughs, and Hakim Bey, accompanied by musical contributions from artists such as Jah Wobble, Sussan Deyhim, Techno Animal, and others. This evocative journey into anarchist philosophy and mysticism unveils the inner history of the Hashisheens, their rituals, and their enduring legacy as a radical sect and secret society.
    <br><br>
    <em>Hashisheen: The End of Law</em> blends ambient music and storytelling, creating a timeless experience that captures the essence of chaos, rebellion, and mysticism. It invites listeners into the rich tapestry of Islamic esotericism and the heretical traditions of the Assassins.

<p>
    Controversial and provocative, the album <em>Hashisheen: The End of Law</em>, produced by Bill Laswell, is the result of two years of intense collaboration and features contributions from a range of iconic voices such as William S. Burroughs, Iggy Pop, Patti Smith, Genesis P-Orridge, and Hakim Bey. Published in 1999 by Sub Rosa, the album explores the mystical story of Hasan-i Sabbah, Alamut, and the Hashisheens, blending spoken word and ambient music to create a visionary experience. 
    <br><br>
    "The work of William S. Burroughs and collaborator Brian Gysin is the main inspiration and key to the initiation of The Hashisheen project," Bill Laswell explains. Inspired by Burroughs and Gysin's cut-up experiments and their obsession with mystical and heretical traditions, the project delves into chaos, ritual magick, and the shadowy tales of secret societies. This conceptual journey combines legendary texts, magical legends, and reflections from both admirers and adversaries of the Assassins.
    <br><br>
    The album is a sonic tapestry featuring voices such as Genesis P-Orridge, Sussan Deyhim, Nicole Blackman, and Hakim Bey. It encapsulates the radical spirit of the Hashisheens, whose libertarian creed is summed up in their famous motto: "Nothing Is True, Everything Is Permitted." Whether reflecting on the lush gardens of Alamut, the rituals of initiation, or the tumultuous power struggles of the Crusades, this album is a captivating exploration of anarchist philosophy and mysticism.

        <p>Hakim Bey’s Ontological Anarchy offers a profound and challenging vision of existence, one that calls for an active embrace of chaos and a rejection of imposed structures. Let’s delve deeper into the philosophy’s key ideas and their broader implications.</p>
        <h5>Core Concepts in Depth</h5>
            <strong>Chaos as Generative</strong><br>
                     Chaos, often viewed negatively as disorder or destruction, is reinterpreted by Bey as the source of creation. In this vision, chaos is life itself—dynamic, unpredictable, and fertile with possibilities.<br><br>
                    By drawing on myths like Tiamat (a primordial goddess symbolizing chaos) and scientific ideas from complexity theory, Bey elevates chaos as essential for growth and transformation.<br><br>
                    Chaos is a state of pure potential where creativity, freedom, and authenticity can flourish. It challenges societal fears of unpredictability, urging us to embrace it as the foundation of meaningful existence.<br><br>
                
            <strong>The Rejection of Order</strong><br>
                
                    Order, in Bey’s philosophy, is not stability but stagnation—a rigid framework that suppresses life’s natural dynamism.<br><br>
                    Systems of statehood, governance, and even morality are seen as artificial constructs designed to constrain human freedom.<br><br>
                    Ontological Anarchy asserts that these imposed orders are illusions, distracting us from the true fluidity of existence. The rejection of these constructs is not chaos for its own sake but a call to unfettered engagement with life’s inherent unpredictability.<br><br>
                
            <strong>Temporality and Physicality in TAZ</strong><br>
                
                     The Temporary Autonomous Zone (TAZ) embodies Bey’s vision of freedom in practice: an ephemeral space where individuals experience collective liberation and creativity.<br><Br>
                     A TAZ is grounded in the real, thriving on the immediacy of shared energy and desire. It exists outside of formalized systems of control, offering a fleeting but transformative experience.<br><br>
                     Events like Burning Man exemplify this idea, creating spaces for self-expression and community while rejecting traditional structures of authority.<br><br>
                
            <strong>Desire and Becoming</strong><br>
                       Desire, for Bey, is a primal and creative force, akin to chaos itself. It is the driving energy behind human action and the key to authentic existence.<br><br>
                    Capitalism manipulates desire, transforming it into unattainable cravings that sustain cycles of alienation and scarcity. This suppression alienates individuals from their true nature and potential.<br><br>
                    Ontological Anarchy seeks to reclaim desire, aligning it with abundance and creativity. Life becomes a process of becoming, where individuals shape their values and experiences through interaction and mutual enhancement.<br><br>
                
            <strong>Language as Liberation</strong><br>
               
                    Traditional language, with its grammar and structure, is viewed as a tool of control—a means of defining, separating, and alienating individuals from one another and from their desires.<br><br>
                    Bey envisions a chaotic, transcendent mode of communication that connects and liberates. Words become tools of creativity, forging deeper connections rather than imposing boundaries.<br><br>
                    This approach invites us to rethink the way language shapes reality, offering the potential for a more authentic and imaginative mode of expression.<br><br>
                
            <strong>Nomadism and Utopian Poetics</strong><br>
                
                    Nomadism symbolizes a philosophical resistance to permanence and rigidity. It celebrates a life of fluidity, spontaneity, and risk—a rejection of societal anchors like work, ownership, and fixed identity.<br><br>
                    Utopian poetics, in this context, act as a visioning tool. They critique the present while offering glimpses of alternative possibilities. This creative practice becomes a means of practical transformation, inspiring both individual and collective reimaginings of the world.<br><br>
                
            
            <strong>Art as Immediate and Communal</strong><br>
                
                    Bey redefines art as a direct and participatory act that enriches life and builds community.<br><br>
                    This vision rejects the commodification of art—its transformation into a product for profit or preservation. Instead, art becomes a joyful, living process, reconnecting individuals to their innate creativity and to one another.<br><br>
                
            
            <strong>Freedom as Process</strong>
						<br>
                    Freedom, for Bey, is not a static condition or a set of granted rights. It is an ongoing process of creation and engagement with the uncertainties of life.<br><br>
                         This view shifts the focus from external systems of governance to the individual and collective act of self-directed becoming. True freedom is experienced in the immediacy of existence, not as an abstract ideal but as a tangible, lived reality.
               
        <h5>Philosophical Implications</h5>
				
            <strong>Beyond Traditional Anarchism</strong><br>
                
                    Traditional anarchism often critiques the state and advocates for alternative organizational systems rooted in natural law or inherent morality.<br><br>
                    Ontological Anarchy goes further, rejecting all predetermined orders as illusions. This includes systems proposed by anarchists themselves, which Bey sees as potentially oppressive.<br><br>
                    By embracing the fluidity of existence, Ontological Anarchy proposes a radical liberation that transcends political frameworks.<br><br>
                
            <strong>Critique of Capitalism</strong><br>
                
                    Capitalism thrives on the suppression of desire, creating systems of perpetual longing that commodify life and imagination.<br><br>
                    Bey’s philosophy critiques this cycle, suggesting that capitalism alienates individuals from their natural abundance and creativity. Instead of fulfilling desires, it perpetuates scarcity and negation.<br><br>
                    Ontological Anarchy fosters systems of gift exchange and creativity, where life is rooted in shared abundance rather than competitive accumulation.<br><br>
                
										<strong>Existential Resonance</strong><br>
                
                    Bey’s ideas resonate with existentialism, particularly its emphasis on freedom, responsibility, and meaning-making in a chaotic world.<br>
                    However, Ontological Anarchy expands this framework by emphasizing collective becoming. Freedom is not a solitary endeavor but a shared, dynamic process that evolves through interaction and creation.<br><br>
                
           
        <h2>Conclusion: The Transformative Power of Ontological Anarchy</h2>
        <p>Hakim Bey’s Ontological Anarchy challenges us to:</p>
        
            • Reimagine chaos as a source of life and creativity.<br><br>
            • Reject imposed structures that constrain freedom and spontaneity.<br><br>
            • Engage in collective creation, fostering values of abundance and mutual enhancement.<br><br>
            • Live authentically and immediately, embracing freedom as an ongoing process.<br><br>
        <p>Through its provocative critique and radical vision, Ontological Anarchy serves as both a philosophical framework and a call to action. It invites us to rethink our relationships with desire, creativity, and one another, offering a path toward a freer, more dynamic existence. By embracing the ceaseless flow of becoming, we transform not only ourselves but the very fabric of the world around us.</p>

            "is anything truly certain when peering
through the Kaleidoscope of
existence imagine for a moment the
profound uncertainty that surrounds the
true nature of things
hakeim Bay in his Manifesto on
autological Anarchy challenges us to
embrace this
uncertainty here at the very precipice
of philosophical exploration B posits
that all societal projects as nche once
suggested are founded on
nothing yet it is from this void this
philosophical nothingness that we must
craft our realities and
resistances it's a call to arms or
rather a call to Minds to Envision a
project and Uprising against every
Proclamation that dictates the supposed
nature of
things as we contemplate the void the
concept of nothing paradoxically begins
to fill with
substance chaos often misconceived as
mere disorder emerges as a central theme
in Ba's
philosophy drawing from ancient myths
and modern science alike chaos is
portrayed not as a void but as a womb of
potential
here lies the Great Serpent be it Tiamat
python or Leviathan encompassing the
Primal chaos that heod and countless
others have whispered
about this chaos is not an absence but a
pregnant silence before the cacophony of
creation where nothing begins to take
shape evolving beyond the confines of
conventional Law and
[Music]
Order In The Narrative of ontological
Anarchy chaos is synonymous with life
itself consider the riot of colors in a
blooming Meadow the Urgent protoplasmic
movements of cells the unpredictable
dances of subatomic particles all are
embodiments of
chaos through Bay's lens order is seen
not as a natural state but as a form of
death a cessation of the dynamic
disorder that is
life thus the anarchist Battle Cry that
anarchy is not chaos becomes a profound
misunderstanding
ontological Anarchy Embraces chaos as
the truest form of existence pushing
back against the alien Silence of
imposed
[Music]
order yet ontological Anarchy is
distinct from traditional
anarchism while anarchism seeks to
dismantle the state and proposes
Alternative forms of organization it
often clings to a notion of natural law
or inherent
morality Bay diver emerging from this
path suggests that such structures are
anathema to True
Freedom there is no natural order no
predestined state of governance and
Chaos all ontological claims to the
contrary are inherently
spurious thus ontological Anarchy is not
merely a critique of statehood or
societal structures but a deeper more
radical rejection of all predetermined
orders celebrating existential freedom
and the spontaneous creation of new
worlds
the critique extends to the very concept
of order and
governance Bay's analysis posits that
any form of order not born from direct
spontaneous action is an illusion a
mirage in the desert of existential
reality such Illusions are powerful they
shape societies inform laws and even
dictate behaviors under the guise of
morality and
justice but for baay these are but
Shadows on the cave wall flickering and
insubstantial ontological Anarchy
encourages us to wake from this Shadow
play to recognize the Phantoms of order
as the constructs they are and to dare
to create a new even under the looming
shadow of the state a giant sustained by
dreams of order that metastasize into
acts of spectacular
[Music]
violence at the heart of ontological
Anarchy pulses the power powerful force
of
Desire this isn't mere wanting it's a
fundamental drive a primal Force as
described by Charles
Fier Bay aligns chaos with Aros
suggesting that just as chaos underpins
creation so too does desire underpin all
human
Endeavors this alignment breaks down the
barriers imposed by societal norms and
capitalist structures suggesting that
true Anarchy Embraces the chaos of
Desire allowing it to lead where it may
it's a stark departure from the notion
that states and structures can contain
or direct these Primal
forces instead Bay posits that the only
true state is one of constant becoming
where governance itself is fluid and
transient much like love or
attraction capitalism according to Bay
is an architecture of Illusion designed
not to fulfill desire but to perpetuate
its unattainability
it creates a cycle of scarcity negation
and alienation a far cry from the
abundance that ontological anarchy
seeks B suggests that capitalism claims
to organize desire but actually
originates in its suppression producing
Commodities that can never satisfy
because their real function is to
sustain an economy of Perpetual
longing the spectacle of capitalism like
a malfunctioning virtual reality program
ultimately reveals nothing but the
skeletal remains of its promises leaving
us with a taste of ashes in our attempts
to consume the
Ethereal language in base critique is
far more than a tool for communication
it is a medium of
control each word each structure of
grammar and syntax serves to separate
and Define to alienate individuals from
one another and from their true
desires ontological Anarchy seeks to
subvert this advocating for a form of
communication that is Angelic
Transcendent and chaotic free from the
rigid constraints of grammar and
normative
structures this vision of language as a
liberating Force invites us to imagine a
world where words do not confine but
connect creating a web of understanding
woven from the very essence of chaos and
creativity the dynamic between self and
is Central to Ba's
philosophy he argues that these are not
fixed categories but fluid identities
that complement and complete each other
within a chaotically interconnected web
of
relationships this view challenges the
dichotomies typically upheld by societal
and political ideologies proposing
instead a model where individual and
Collective identities enhance and extend
one another through interactions defined
by Mutual enhancement rather other than
competition or
domination this is the strange attractor
of ontological Anarchy the force that
evokes patterns and resonances in the
flow of becoming where values and
relationships are continually recreated
in response to desire and
connection emerging from Ba's philosophy
is a profound critique of values as they
are typically
understood in a world governed by
scarcity values are often based on what
is lacking however ontological Anarchy
proposes a foundation of
abundance here values are not imposed or
inherited but are dynamically generated
through interactions characterized by
the gift rather than the
commodity this approach Fosters a
society where Synergy and mutual
enhancement Prevail over the
individualistic competitive ethos of
capitalism values arising from such
turbulence are inherent ly opposed to
the static death oriented values of
civilization because they are born of
life itself everchanging ever evolving
and deeply rooted in the chaotic energy
of
[Music]
creation freedom in the landscape of
ontological Anarchy is not a static
state to be achieved but a continuous
Act of Creation and
becoming B challenges us to see Freedom
as a psychokinetic skill a process
process that is inherently Dynamic and
intrinsically tied to the immediate
experience of
living this Vision disrupts traditional
Notions of Freedom as a set of Rights or
conditions granted by external
authorities and instead celebrates it as
an Ever evolving dance with chaos and
desire it is here in the active
engagement with life's uncertainties and
the Embrace of spontaneous creation that
true Freedom manifests not as an
abstract ideal but as a lived visceral
real
ity nomadism represents not just a
physical condition but a philosophical
stance within ontological
Anarchy Bay promotes a model of
existence that rejects permanent
structures in favor of a fluid everm
moving
life this is evident in his appreciation
of the bedin or the commune as symbols
of resistance against the static and
oppressive nature of the state and its
architectures
in this View nomadism and the uprising
are intertwined Concepts both advocate
for a life of Celebration and risk of
constant movement and flux which defy
the conventional anchors of
society this nomatic Spirit challenges
the prism of work and the economy of
lost time advocating instead for a life
filled with spontaneous adventure and
genuine
encounters utopian Poetics play a
crucial role in ontological Anarchy
serving as a lens through which we can
reimagine our desires and
potentials B uses the concept of the
utopian mirror not just to project a
nopl place but to critique and reshape
the present according to the
possibilities of what could
be this approach allows for a critical
theory that is not confined to academic
speculation but is deeply engaged with
the material and imaginative elements of
everyday
life the utopian Vision thus becomes a
practical tool for transformation
enabling us to Envision and enact the
kinds of social relations and
experiences that conventional political
and philosophical discourse deem
[Music]
impossible art in the world of
ontological Anarchy is reimagined as a
communal spontaneous act rather than a
commodity to be
consumed ba argues for form of creative
expression that transcends traditional
boundaries where art becomes a direct
experience of Play gift exchange and
communal
participation this vision sees the
withering away of art as it has been
known replaced by an immediate
gratifying practice of creativity that
enhances life
directly art in this context is not
about reproduction for the sake of
preservation or profit but about the
joyful expression of living in the
moment M thus reconnecting us with the
Primal energies of creation and
Community finally ontological Anarchy is
not just a theoretical
framework it is a call to action a
beckoning towards active participation
in the creation of life as an art
form Ba's text is an invitation to
embrace the insurrectionary nature of
the festival where each moment is an
opportunity for radical transformation
and joyous
Rebellion this conclusion challenges us
to Step Beyond the pages of theory into
the vibrant chaotic flow of lived
experience where every individual act
can contribute to a broader reimagining
of
society it's a call to wake up to play
to create and to live authentically and
freely within the immediate magic of our
interactions and our
passions through these discussions we've
traversed the landscape of ontological
Anarchy exploring its challenging
inspiring and often bewildering
terrain Bas philosophy offers not just a
critique but a profound reconfiguration
of how we might live interact and
dream in the spirit of ontological
Anarchy let us now carry forward these
ideas not as mere Spectators but as
active participants in the ceaseless
flow of
becoming thank you for joining me on
this explor
Journey may it ignite in you the desire
to question to create and to transform"

   <strong>Visiting ‘Hakim Bey’ (Peter Lamborn Wilson)</strong>
</a> - This YouTube video documents a meeting with the renowned anarchist philosopher Peter Lamborn Wilson, who wrote under the pseudonym Hakim Bey. The visit took place in June 2004 when Dammbeck and Sabine Schenk met Wilson to gather material for the website associated with Dammbeck’s film “The Net”.
                    
                        In their discussions, they explored topics like spirituality, technology, politics, art, and resistance—themes central to Wilson’s work, especially his influential book, “TAZ: The Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism”, which became a cult text among the first generation of hackers and cyberpunks.
                    
                        The video offers insights into Wilson’s philosophical perspectives and his reflections on the intersection of spirituality and anarchism, providing a rare glimpse into his thoughts beyond his written work.

												<h2>Wilson Critiques the Trajectory of Modernity</h2>
    <p>Wilson explores the historical and philosophical underpinnings of resistance movements. Here’s a detailed breakdown of its depth and meaning:</p>

            <h5>Personal History and Counterculture Experience</h5>
            
                <strong>Educational Background:</strong> Wilson’s choice to leave academia reflects his rejection of institutional frameworks, favoring experiential and spiritual learning.<br><br>
                <strong>Influence of the 1960s:</strong> He credits the countercultural explosion, particularly psychedelics and Eastern spirituality, as central to his intellectual and personal growth. This era fostered his belief in alternative ways of living and thinking, outside traditional Western paradigms.<br><br>
                <strong>Journey to the East:</strong> His travels to Morocco, India, and Iran represent a search for spiritual and cultural depth absent in Western modernity. His time in Iran, before and during the revolution, profoundly shaped his understanding of cultural resistance and tradition.<br><br>

       
            <strong>Critique of Modernity and Technological Alienation</strong>
           <br><br>
                <strong>Technology as Isolation:</strong> Wilson argues that technologies like the automobile, television, and later the internet, contribute to individual atomization and the breakdown of communal life.<br><br>
                <strong>The Internet:</strong> Initially seen as a tool of liberation, the internet, for Wilson, has become an intensification of alienation. Corporate control and commodification have transformed it into a system that reinforces technocratic domination.<br><br>
                <strong>Technocracy vs. Technology:</strong> Wilson distinguishes between technology as a tool and technocracy as a system that imposes control and alienates individuals.<br><br>

        
            <strong>The Temporary Autonomous Zone (TAZ)</strong><br><br>
            
                <strong>Definition and Misinterpretation:</strong> TAZ is a sociological observation of how people naturally seek moments and spaces of freedom and intense communal living.<br><br>
                <strong>Physical and Communal:</strong> TAZ exists in real time and space, requiring physical presence and collective action.<br><br>
                <strong>Examples:</strong> Events like Burning Man serve as modern approximations of TAZ, though Wilson notes their commercialization dilutes their authenticity.<br><br>

        
            <strong>Spirituality and Resistance</strong><br><br>
            
                <strong>Critique of Rationalism:</strong> Wilson critiques the Enlightenment’s emphasis on rationalism, which he sees as alienating the spirit from the body.<br><br>
                <strong>Spiritual Awakening:</strong> Resistance movements, for Wilson, require a spiritual push that combines intellect and heart.<br><br>
                <strong>Romanticism and Psychedelics:</strong> He aligns with Romantic and psychedelic traditions as counterpoints to technocratic rationalism.<br><br>

        
            <strong>Anarchism and Revolutionary Tactics</strong><br><br>
            
                <strong>Futility of Violence:</strong> Wilson critiques violent revolutionary tactics, arguing they fail to address systemic issues.<br><br>
                <strong>Symbolic Resistance:</strong> Much of modern resistance is symbolic rather than transformative.<br><br>
                <strong>Need for Unity:</strong> He mourns the fragmentation of countercultural movements that once worked together.<br><br>

        
            <strong>Historical and Philosophical Analysis</strong>
           <br><br>
                <strong>Cartesian Dualism:</strong> Wilson critiques the Cartesian split between mind and body, which he sees as foundational to the alienation of modernity.<br><br>
                <strong>Missed Paradigms:</strong> He laments the historical defeat of hermetic and Romantic traditions by Cartesian and Newtonian paradigms.<br><br>
                <strong>Islamic and Chinese Civilizations:</strong> Wilson explores why these civilizations did not follow the West’s path to modernity.<br><br>
            <strong>Isolation and Symbolic Discourse</strong>
           
                <strong>Personal Isolation:</strong> Wilson’s rejection of machines and technocracy leaves him isolated.<br><br>
                <strong>Frustration with Symbolism:</strong> As an artist and writer, Wilson expresses frustration with the limitations of symbolic discourse.<br><br>

    <h5>Key Reflections</h5>
       <strong>On the Internet’s Evolution:</strong> Wilson critiques the early optimism about the internet, observing its corporatization.<br><br>
        <strong>On Community and Action:</strong> The fragmentation of countercultural communities contrasts with the collective energy of the 1960s.<br><br>
        <strong>On Spirituality:</strong> A recurring theme is the need for a spiritual dimension in resistance.<br><br>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The transcript is a profound critique of modernity’s alienating effects, examining the interplay of technology, spirituality, and resistance. Wilson’s reflections blend nostalgia for the collective energy of past movements with a deep concern for the current trajectory of human society.</p>

            "surely
so um
well um i didn't study i'm a college  dropout i i grew up in the academic  
world and i thought i would be part of it but  i changed my mind in in the 60s lsd helped
and then in 1968 i along with a lot  of other people i thought that we  
had tried to have a revolution and we had failed so i went to india i went to morocco india  ended up in iran and i spent 10 years  
in the east and basically that was my education  i uh as it turned out it was my education at the  
time i thought that i was never going back to  america because i thought that america was uh  
too much of a problem that i  couldn't deal with it but um so in um  
but after the iranian revolution you know i had  to leave iran so um i spent a couple of years in  
england and europe and then finally drifted  back to america what comes to mind is most   characteristic is that i still think uh that  um uh that we had a revolution and it failed  
in other words my reading back of the of the  uh that period um is that that genuine social  
revolution was proposed in an incoherent way yes  incoherent but but real and it was attempted in  
a lot of different ways socially politically even  militantly if not militarily yes even militarily  
perhaps in some places uh actually you know  italy in 1972 is almost a military situation
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah all that and he had  contact with uh germany no no me no no i was  
i was more of a hippie than a new left person i  was sympathetic to the revolution but not very  
knowledgeable about it at the time and basically  my part of it was you know the the hippie part  
not the yippy part or the  you know the new left part
there was also however this great  tradition in america that started   in 1913 among most mostly amongst  black people uh of a moorish science  
specifically of course it means morocco but in  general it could mean any muslim and in fact   you know they called but the more morals of of in  the philippines so like turk was also a word that  
didn't necessarily mean somebody from turkey it  meant any kind of muslim so more in the same way  
but in some black people it was the sort of the  beginnings of black islam in america in 1913 which  
leads to malcolm x that's the end on one direction  yes but in another direction not so there's many  
split ups many different sects and so forth and  one of these sects was much more friendly to uh  
to white people if they were willing to  declare themselves to be celtic okay or persian  
in any case it was a very fascinating black  american a lot of jazz musicians and that kind  
of people involved in it so the hippies  and jazz musicians you know beatniks and  
black people and so forth  mixed together in baltimore   and brooklyn and new york and places like that  it's gnostic based [Music] it's a it's uh what  
can i say it's a syncretistic sect which  is partly islamic and partly other things  
and uh it's certainly from an islamic position  point of view is pretty heretical certainly  
not orthodox but um some you know hippies got  involved in this and then out of that uh came the  
moorish orthodox church which has you know been  a small organization but it's existed ever since  
and there there are people now doing it you  know i have nothing very little to do with them   that's they they pick up the ball and play with it  themselves you know it's a very loosely organized  
religious sentiment you know is this a real tuts  no well no no no no no it's it's a it's a religion  
it's it's a cult a sect it's not a  it's not a place or a time it's it's it  
and it's very similar to some of the psychedelic  religions that were founded in the in the sixties   we weren't specifically psychedelic but we were  part of that movement very much so and that's  
you know uh when we went up to millbrook to be  with leary that's who we identified ourselves  
all these different types in the 60s the  political type and the hippie type and the   drug type and the art type and so forth they  all felt that they could work together now  
everyone is separated everyone all these groups  are atomized split apart distracted separated  
why it's you know it's just the spirit of the  times if i mean i could just say it's the spirit  
of the times or else machines are this machine  based systems yes that has something to do with it  
that has something to do with it i was thinking  the other day about television and the automobile   and how they caught how they coexist  correspond on different levels in history  
they're both machines to separate people  yeah the car and the car the automobile  
starts to replace public transportation  in around 1910 and by 1950 it succeeded  
so there's no more public public public  transportation in america is ruined what is  
left is only for poor people so it's crappy uh the  automobile separates each individual into an atom  
a moving atom it breaks up communities it creates  this highway suburb system that further breaks  
up communities actually physically it breaks up  communities economically and it actually breaks up  
things physically just by separating  you can jump in your car and drive away  
at the same time you have radio and television  coming in which which are instead of public  
entertainment you now have also separate  atomized modes of entertainment the television  
and the the the triumph of the automobile in  about 1950 corresponds with the appearance of the  
commercial appearance of television in about  1950. so it really works out very nicely and  
um you know i mean there's just so much the human  spirit can do when it's uh wrapped up from birth  
from the moment of birth in a technocratic sphere  uh where meaning is transferred to the uh to the  
inorganic on a regular you know basis in education  and culture and the home in all aspects of what  
we used to call the social and in this sense the  internet is not a change it's an intensification  
you know just as the internet and genetic  manipulation you know bio the bio uh technology  
these are the this is the next pair the next  matched pair yeah yeah yeah that actually  
commodified life the inner yeah the interior  if you like or life itself uh to modify the  
imagination instead of just the uh i don't know  what the attention commodified life itself or  
other you know the body itself rather than  just the so-called needs of the of the body so  
each of these each of these technocratic movements  you know plunges us deeper and deeper into into  
this state of uh alienation to i don't know to use  an old marxist word uh as loosely as possible okay
into uh separation might be a better term  
and um uh you know you can you can uh uh you  can object to this as much as you like you can  
weep and moan about this as much as you like  but it doesn't change the basic situation   you can go online and complain about the fact  that you have to be online you know what i mean  
i you know i know very few people there in in  the 90s there were there were thousands of them  
now it's hard to find them people who are you  know politically enthusiastic about the internet  
and uh who still think of it as a uh somehow force  of liberation these people are getting fewer and  
fewer mostly i find when i talk to people they're  saying oh i hate this [ __ ] but i have to do it   i have to do it it's my job right most people  most people are now working at this it's their  
job there's nothing liberating about that for  [ __ ] sake you know it's over the liberating part  
is over and in 1995 i remember we all said this  is the year of the internet this is it the last  
year of the internet is what we meant because the  experiment was over and the the returns were in  
the corporate reality had taken over and um  the fact that you can still use the internet to  
you know run an end game around the media  like happened with the torture stuff from iraq  
it doesn't seem all that significant to me i mean  ultimately some british journalist or some you  
know european journalist would have blown the  story anyway whether there was an internet or   not might have made a difference of a few days  so i don't see this is people you know every  
time something like this happens on the internet  oh it's a great triumph for electronic freedom   very few people believe that anymore i think  it's just it's just another gadget right now
but you know the taz is also  just a sociological observation
whatever you know it's a you know it's a  sociological observation about the way human  
beings behave it's not uh it's not a purely  utopian concept okay uh people act that way  
because it's the logical way to act you know if  you if a group if a large enough group of people  
it might only be two or it might be thousands uh  but uh we're talking about a group from two to a  
couple thousand well not endless but you know  because two bit too big would be impossible  
that would be something else again now we're  in a different sociology this is a sociology  
of the natural impulse of people when they're  in a high spirit and have positive energy to  
remove themselves perhaps even in not even in  a militant way from authority uh and to live  
to live intensely yeah and this intensity  is sometimes politically hard to define  
and in different ages it might have different  manifestations but the basic sociology the free  
group uh so and and the the time and place you  know the temper the the time and place aspect  
in other words that it's not going to last  very long because it depends on high spirits  
you know no real place it is a real place it  must be a real place yeah it has to happen
what i'm talking about is a physical time and  place not a mental not cybernetic not imaginary it  
has all those aspects possibly but if it doesn't  have the physic physical space then i don't call  
it a zone it's not a zone okay and the people  who misinterpreted what i was saying to think  
that it had something to do with the internet  were wrong the ta-z is not on the internet  
time magazine said that actually because of  course they didn't bother to read a word i said  
um no no no no no no the most i ever said  about the internet was that it should be uh  
should should be a tool for maximizing  the potential for the emergence of a taz  
i never said that it was the taz personally  i don't get along with machines i never have  
i don't you know i'm not a gadget lover i don't  drive and that's not entirely by choice [Laughter]  
it's partly by choice but it's not entirely  by choice i don't have a television i managed   to get rid of television about 10 or  15 years ago and i never missed it  
i don't have a computer and i never had a computer   well i had a computer for a few weeks and then  i got rid of it i realized this was not for me  
so you know physically and mentally i'm very bad  with machines but on the other hand i think this   gives me a certain instance this uh this personal  problem gives me a certain insight into a larger  
political sociological situation where
basically i decided that i would  throw in my lot with the lost  
uh hopeless stupid people who would never be on  the internet i thought i would stay with them
as a gesture you know as a gesture of  solidarity a futile stupid gesture but a gesture  
and um maybe uh eventually i would discover a  new network of people who were you know also  
rejecting certain aspects of what i now consider  to be technocracy rather than just technology  
that hasn't really happened that you know i mean  i wish i could say yes and now there are you know  
a solidarity network of tens of thousands of  people who you know refuse cars and refuse  
computers and you know but no  i don't i'm completely isolated  
i'm completely isolated because the other  people the other people who don't have computers   are poor peasants you know i'm not  in touch with any poor peasants  
but you are living also as a second part or a  part of your personality is living on the internet
it's a strange little accident  of history as part of it when i   brought out the book and i had a few things to say  in the book about the internet very few really and  
i put the book under an anti-copyright you know  remember the anti-copyright and somehow the book  
became a little mascot of the early hackers uh  you know back in the bbs days of the internet the  
crude early pioneer days of the internet so for  some reason my work it always was has always been  
there and i guess it always will be there because  there's no way to erase it you know in fact the  
original message was this is anti-copyright but  if you use anything please tell me well of course  
most people don't some people wrote fake material  and put it on the internet under my name [Music]  
i can't stop them how am i supposed to stop them   there's nothing i can there's nothing i can  do about it so i never never never tried to  
do anything about it i hate this uh way in  which the internet sucks you into these um
uh corpse like you know like this corpse uh  fight you know fight between two corpses you know  
i'm not interested in fighting  with these cyber spirits you know   um i'm really really sort of sick of symbolic  discourse i hate i'm starting to hate it you  
know which is a very bad position  for an artist and a writer to be in   since that's what we do is symbolic discourse but  this whole the whole idea of discourse has become  
poisonous you know it means this curse uh with the  neo primitive is with like john satsang and others  
well guess even that i mean the fact is that  within within the anarchist or anti-authoritarian  
or i don't know whatever this you know world  is there's nothing going on except symbolic  
discourse you know nothing even if you  want to talk about what the unabomber did  
basically it's just symbolism so you know yes he  blew up a few computer shops and killed one or two  
pretty awful [ __ ] people but you know it  wasn't real revolutionary action it was symbolic  
it was largely symbolic and the rest of it is  just blah blah blah on the internet you know  
a real good t-a-z in america would be the burning  man festival i wouldn't ask you for this yeah  
yeah it's a well actually i call it a periodic  autonomous zone because it happens every year  
if it happened only once and lasted for like  four weeks three weeks or four weeks something  
i'd say that was you know really great temporary  autonomous zone now it happens every year so it's  
a periodic autonomous zone uh you get the idea  but it has to be a place and it has to be a time  
but the question is could this room  here be also a temporary autonomous  
zone that would entirely depend on what  happened in the room i can't just say  
you know i now declare this you can't  be alone in a room and it's a toxic  
no you see no no again again i look on this as a  sociological fact that means more than one person  
more than one person yeah and so the universe  couldn't be create a temporary autonomous zone  
in this cabin no no i mean he could create  something else i don't know what it is but  
i mean to me we're talking about politics  so politics means at least one other person
uh and in fact you know there's no such thing  as an isil as the isolated individual really   you know we know that i mean without trying to  talk i'm not being metaphysical here i'm just  
saying this is obviously so you know not even not  even sterner believed in the completely isolated
that individual right to be he tried but he  even he had to talk about the union of egoists
i'm not against the man i just think that  what he did was futile and rather stupid   i don't agree with zerzane and making him into  a big hero i sympathize with him you know but  
uh um i don't agree it's a wrong tactic  wrong tactic yeah what that you should do
well that's a good question of course that's  a very good question and the fact that i can't  
answer it doesn't negate my critique but it does  weaken it i admit okay i wish i could say that i  
knew what to do you know i mean it's a horrible  thing to say but if there was a hundred thousand  
una bombers maybe we would get somewhere you know  it's uh the the difference between terrorism and  
and militant action you know we've seen we've seen  that the terror is a very ambiguous double-edged  
sword uh ever since the 1890s and the failures  of all the assassinations and attentats and so  
forth to bring on any kind of an anarchist  revolution and over and over again you know  
people like emma goldman had to say well you know  uh we love the sinner but we hate the sin you know  
you know yes we have great sympathy for leon  colgosh but it's really too bad that he shot   the president it was a stupid thing to do you  know and this has been the anarchist position  
the sensible anarchist position ever since then  that just you know it's like supposing you went  
and supposedly you found out who the ceo of the  big evil corporation was and you went and killed  
that person would it make one bit of difference  in the world no they just come with a new ceo  
i mean there's lots of talented people in this  universe you know there's no shortage of smart   people who are willing to sell themselves to the  devil that's the traditional way by anarchism is  
to kill some some of the leaders yeah yeah and to  create well we were wrong yeah we were wrong and  
i think that we should have realized how wrong  we were right from about 1890 onwards uh but i  
without some kind of spiritual push i don't see  how all of this resistance all these millions  
of people who are angry but don't know how to do  anything about it how do they come together what  
could make them into a movement excuse me would  have to be something along the lines of esprit  
you know of a kind of combination of intellect and  heart head and heart you know because otherwise  
um you know otherwise it's just it's just  sentimentality it's just a sentiment for  
something that we've lost some social some memory  of the social that disappeared around 1995 finally  
um so i would say that uh if you want me if you  want my anti-pessimistic point of view would  
have to be involved somehow with spirituality  but that would mean a chump in consciousness  
well i think that as far as that goes we've been  working on that at least since the 60s even longer  
at least as i say since the 60s if  not since the beginning of romanticism  
it's always you can always push things back and  back and back but if we want to talk about the   modern moment i think it's the 60s when when with  the psychedelic and the rediscovery at least for  
us you know because we weren't europeans so  we had to suddenly we discovered surrealism  
you know just one thing what you were saying that  enlightening enlightenment is part of the problem  
what do you mean by that well i mean that the 18th  century alf clarence is part of the problem it's  
like what uh adorno i think it was who said  about the uh the cruel instrumentality of  
reason that is also part of the problem well  at least he knew it though apparently if he  
coined a phrase like that because that says it  to me it's the cruel instrumentality of reason  
rationalism you know rationality rationalism  rationality is fine the rationality is good  
rationality is so rare you might as well call  it psychedelic i mean human beings are almost  
never rational but rationalistic all the time you  know especially since the 18th century rationalism  
yes we've got way too much rationalism not enough  rationality and you look at the who are the most  
rational people for example on the question of  drugs are the drug users they're the ones who talk  
you know who see the complete irrationality of the  of the the war on drugs for example that this is  
economically politically psychologically  spiritual in every way irrational  
so it's the drug users who are rational but  they're supposed to be or i should say we we  
are supposed to be the irrational ones or the  irrational or this or the surrealist ones or   something no one ever gives us credit for being  rational that's because the elf clarum caused  
this split between rationality and rationalism  yeah it's possible to be completely spiritual and  
romantic and still be rational be a rational human  being not blue little frothing at the mouth crazy  
yeah so that's what i mean by the problem of  enlightenment but uh the islamic societies they  
stopped the way which just leads to enlightenment  or the outcome in the 18th century why do you  
think well they stopped even sooner than that if  you want to be specific about it they they had  
as you pointed out before there's no islamic  renaissance so we can't obviously talk about  
if there's an elf clearing it's only in the 19th  century and it's in purely imitation of the west  
it's people like afghani and muhammad abdul and  so forth but um there was never any renaissance  
either in islam and or china and joseph  needham the great historian of chinese  
science already noticed this uh that at a certain  point both china and islam were way ahead of the  
west technologically and scientifically and why  didn't they make the transition why couldn't  
they make the transition to modern science and  renaissance and reformation and so forth and so on  
but why did they stop they hadn't known well  knowledge about what is coming a feeling  
there are two ways you could look at this one is  to say that they stopped because their systems   themselves were uh were flawed they were over  developed hyper developed rather than developed  
that's more or less needham's position uh the  other position is that they didn't that they  
didn't do that because that would have meant a  break with spiritual tradition that they were   not prepared to take that the renaissance  and leading on to the industrial revolution  
is a radical break with human spirituality that  was not possible for islamic civilization or  
chinese civilization this is an interesting  position i wouldn't want to say that
you know therefore islam is good and the west is  evil or some stupid result you know some stupid uh  
reduc reduction of this idea but  nevertheless there's some interesting   aspects to that thought  that that a culture which is  
rooted in some kind of a respect for the world  as a divine manifestation cannot make the step  
to a science which is ascending which is  essentially going to end up with an anti-human  
or an inhuman position and the problem as  the muslim critic would see it is that in  
christianity in christian culture the split  between the body and the spirit was too radical  
too radical almost dualist almost dualistic  so that in the west this movement towards the  
industrial revolution could come because the body  was completely unimportant and only the spirit was  
real whereas for china especially and for islam  apparently to a certain extent at least this  
was not true that the body was somehow divine  enough that it had its own inalienable sphere  
and uh that the both on the  conscious and the unconscious level  
it would be impossible for an islamic scientist  or a chinese scientist to make the step  
towards so denying the body as for example  descartes denied the body all right the bodies
oh they're all david they are all the cartesians  they're all cartesians descartes focuses this for  
us with the body is dead meat and the  mind is the only spark of the divine  
but the new machines and the systems they are  not interested for the body and the spirit  
that's right they're all cartesian  or whatever they have one and zero   and it's a clear position that's right  it's still dates till decart but then  
then can we not uh work with his machines then the  machines are representations of the wrong system  
possibly wrong possibly you know just because  the technology works doesn't mean that it's true  
i i have to maintain this in the face of uh of any  any arguments about uh logical consistency here um  
you know just because the steam engine worked  doesn't mean it's god the way freud thought it  
was you know apparently freud thought the steam  engine was god because he constructed the entire   unconscious on an analogy with the steam engine  apparently we think the computer is god because  
all of our analogies about consciousness are now  based on the computer the brain is a computer  
or if it isn't it soon will be a mere machine  yeah that's right a meat machine long machine  
um you know so nothing very new about these ideas  they go they go back to lametri and descartes  
if you look at cuzanus and bruno and pico de la  mirindola and marcilio ficino and that whole crowd  
they were attempting to dignify the the body again  contra the church okay um they they with kuzanas  
who said the earth that the earth was sacred you  know actually he said the the earth was a star  
and worthy of uh worthy of dignity and and  adulation in other words it was the gist of  
pico's ideas were there in kusanas now to me this  is not the winning paradigm these are the losers  
okay the winners are the the whole line of  thought that lead uh led to uh to descartes  
um those are and to newton and well leibniz  is a funny figure right is he a hermeticist  
or is he the other one you know leibniz has  these hermetic in fact they all had her medic  
hermeticist interests newton was a tremendous  alchemist but of course he suppressed that  
uh so i it was in this quarrel between hermeticism  newtonianism and cartesianism i think basically it  
was a three-way quarrel and hermeticism could have  been modern science the way we would have liked  
to have seen it with the sacred earth theory you  know a theory of sacred earth uh even newtonianism  
might have been that but unfortunately it  wasn't and when it came down to it newtonian  
and cartesian ideas join together to defeat the  hermeticists this is what romanticism is all about  
as soon as as soon as her mysticism is crushed  it pops up again as romanticism but now it's  
not a scientific paradigm anymore it's crazy it's  poetry it's pseudoscience it's natural philosophy

       <strong>From the book Ec(o)logs by Peter Lamborn Wilson</strong>
    </a> - This YouTube video, filmed by Raymond Foye in 2011, captures a reading from *Ec(o)logs* by Peter Lamborn Wilson (also known as Hakim Bey). The event took place at The Church of the Holy Transfiguration of Christ on the Mount in Woodstock, NY, and was published by Station Hill Press in the same year.
    
    <br>
		
		
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>The “Neo-Pastoralist Manifesto” from his book <em>Ec(o)logs</em> is a provocative and multilayered critique of industrial civilization and a call for a return to more harmonious relationships with nature, community, and spirituality. The manifesto is structured into thirteen points, each offering a distinct yet interconnected perspective on resisting modernity and re-enchanting the world.</p>

            <h5>1. Endarkenment</h5>
            
						<strong>Deliberate Inculcation of Irrational Superstition:</strong><br><br>
					Wilson challenges the Enlightenment’s emphasis on rationality (“Enlightenment”) by proposing an “Endarkenment,” a re-embrace of mystery, myth, and the irrational aspects of human experience.<br><br>
					This is a call to value intuition, folklore, and the mystical connections humans have with nature.<br><br>
					
					<strong>Pagan Animist Fear of Nature:</strong><br><br>
					Advocates for rekindling ancient beliefs that see nature as alive with spirits and forces deserving respect and awe.<br><br>
					Suggests that modern society’s detachment from these beliefs has led to ecological destruction.<br><br>
					<strong>Victory for Fairies and Black Snails:</strong><br><br>
                    
                        Symbolizes a triumph of the marginalized, the overlooked, and the mythical entities of folklore.<br><br>
                        Represents a desire to re-center the natural world’s intrinsic value over human dominance.<br><br>
												
            <h4>Interpretation:</h4>
            <p>Wilson is urging a paradigm shift away from anthropocentric and rationalist worldviews. By embracing the “Endarkenment,” humanity can reconnect with the spiritual and mystical dimensions of nature, fostering a deeper respect and perhaps averting ecological catastrophe.</p>
						
            <h5>2. Secular Anabaptism</h5>
            
                <strong>Reverting to Amish Ways circa 1907:</strong><br><br>
                    
                        Suggests adopting the lifestyle of the Amish community from the early 20th century as a model for simplicity and sustainability.<br><br>
                        Emphasizes living without modern technologies like electricity, internal combustion engines, and telephones.<br><br>
                   
												<strong>Secular Approach:</strong><br><br>
                    
                        While the Amish live this way for religious reasons, Wilson proposes a secular adoption of their practices.<br><br>
                        ocuses on the practical benefits of reducing technological dependence.<br><br>
                    
                
            <h4>Interpretation:</h4>
            <p>Wilson recognizes that a full return to pre-industrial times (“stone age”) isn’t feasible but suggests that adopting simpler, technology-free lifestyles can reduce the negative impacts of modernity. This is both a critique of technological overreach and a practical suggestion for ecological living.</p>

            <h5>3. Escapism</h5>
            
                <strong>Emulating Anabaptists and Dropping Out:</strong><br><br>
                    
                        Encourages individuals to withdraw from mainstream society as a form of protest and self-preservation.<br><br>
                        “Strategic retreat” implies a calculated withdrawal to create alternative spaces.<br><br>
                    
                
                <strong>Claiming Religious Exemption:</strong><br><br>
                    
                        Suggests using legal frameworks that allow for religious freedom to opt out of certain societal obligations.<br><br>
                        This is a tactic to create autonomous zones where alternative ways of living can be practiced.<br><br>
                
                <strong>Places of Authentic Sadness:</strong><br><br>
                    
                        Refers to spaces untouched by modernity’s superficial happiness, where genuine human emotions and connections to nature persist.<br><br>
                        Emphasizes the value of confronting and embracing authentic experiences, even if they are melancholic.<br><br>
												
            <h4>Interpretation:</h4>
            <p>Wilson proposes that disengaging from the structures of modern society can be a powerful act of resistance. By creating and inhabiting spaces outside mainstream culture, individuals can preserve and cultivate more authentic and sustainable ways of living.</p>

            <h4>Interpretation:</h4>

                        Suggests that self-consciousness complicates our ability to harmonize with the natural world.<br><br>
												
                <strong>Desire for Union with Nature:</strong><br><br>

                        Highlights the alienation caused by modernity.<br><br>
                
            <h4>Interpretation:</h4>
            <p>Wilson delves into the complexities of human desires that transcend societal norms, particularly regarding nature and sexuality.

                <strong>Return of the Golden Age:</strong>
							          Saturn is often associated with a mythical time of abundance and peace.<br><br>
                        Neo-pastoralism seeks to revive this era’s values through a balance of reflection and joy.<br><br>
												
            <h4>Interpretation:</h4>
            <p>Wilson uses the dual nature of Saturn to illustrate the necessity of embracing contradictions. By acknowledging both the melancholy and the ecstatic, neo-pastoralism aims to create a richer, more nuanced approach to life and resistance.</p>
						
            <h5>10. Thelemite Pantasocracy</h5>

                        Draws inspiration from the Zapatista movement, which combines indigenous traditions with revolutionary action.<br><br>

                <strong>Violence at an Impossible Angle to Police Power:</strong><br><br>
                   
                        Proposes forms of resistance that are unconventional and difficult for authorities to counter.<br><br>
                        Acknowledges that these ideas are speculative (“well into the fantasy realm”) and may not have real-world examples.<br><br>
                
            
            <h4>Interpretation:</h4>
            <p>Wilson explores the concept of nostalgia as an active, even militant, force for change. By romanticizing and reviving past ways of life, individuals can resist modern systems of control.

                        These zones range from simple gatherings to more sustained communities.<br><br>
            
            <h4>Interpretation:</h4>

        <strong>Rituals and Excess:</strong><br><br>

                Frames the TPZ itself as a work of art, a living expression of alternative values.<br><br>
                Activities like readings, music, and theater are not just entertainment but acts of re-enchantment and defiance.<br><br>
								
    <h4>Interpretation:</h4>
    <p>The appendix provides practical guidance on how to implement the concepts outlined in the manifesto. By creating TPZs, individuals can enact the principles of neo-pastoralism, experiencing and demonstrating that alternative ways of living are possible.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Peter Lamborn Wilson’s “Neo-Pastoralist Manifesto” is a rich tapestry of ideas that intertwine ecological consciousness, mystical traditions, anarchist theory, and artistic expression. At its core, the manifesto critiques the alienation and destruction wrought by modern industrial society and offers a vision for re-establishing harmony with nature and reclaiming authentic human experiences.</p>
    <p>Wilson’s proposals are both practical and fantastical, blending actionable steps with imaginative visions. He challenges readers to rethink their relationship with technology, society, and the natural world, urging a return to practices that honor the sacredness of life and the environment.</p>
    <p>By advocating for the creation of Temporary Pastoral Zones and embracing concepts like “endarkenment” and “queer pastoralism,” Wilson invites individuals to participate in a form of resistance that is deeply personal, communal, and transformative. The manifesto serves as both a critique of the present and a blueprint for a more enchanted and sustainable future.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Understanding Wilson’s manifesto requires an openness to exploring unconventional ideas and a willingness to question deeply ingrained societal norms. His work is a call to action that transcends mere environmentalism or political activism; it is an invitation to reimagine what it means to be human in relation to the world around us. By blending historical references with contemporary critiques, Wilson provides a multifaceted approach to resisting the dehumanizing aspects of modernity and fostering a renewed connection with the natural and spiritual realms.</p>

       <strong>Peter Lamborn Wilson on Poetry, Archaeology, and Anthropology</strong>
    </a> - In this video, Peter Lamborn Wilson (aka Hakim Bey) discusses the poet's role in interpreting archaeology, anthropology, and human pre-history. He urges poets to engage with these disciplines and interpret evidence where scientists hesitate to draw conclusions. Wilson introduces the concept of "anti-categorization" and explores ideas about consciousness, Neanderthals, paleolithic writing, and myths like Marduk and Gilgamesh. 
    
    The talk includes references to notable thinkers such as Marija Gimbutas, Claude Levi-Strauss, Terrence McKenna, and Georges Bataille. It also highlights Wilson's book *Ploughing the Clouds: The Search for Irish Soma*, where he investigates the entheogenic traditions of ancient Ireland, linking intoxication with poetic inspiration.

    <br><br>
		<h2>Key Themes from the Lecture</h2>

<p>
<strong>1. Interdisciplinary Thought and Ethnopoetics</strong><br><br>
&bull; <em>Hypothesis as Art:</em> Wilson describes his work as “air art,” emphasizing the imaginative and non-dogmatic nature of his hypotheses, which serve to provoke thought rather than assert definitive truths.<br>
&bull; <em>Ethnopoetics:</em> He underscores the importance of investigative poetics, suggesting that poetry and cultural inquiry can enrich each other, drawing parallels between the study of ancient cultures and the creative act of poetry.
</p>

<p>
<strong>2. The Role of Psychedelics and Entheogens</strong><br><br>
&bull; Wilson delves into the theory that consciousness may have been catalyzed by the ingestion of psychotropic plants, aligning with ideas from thinkers like Terence McKenna.<br>
&bull; Psychedelics are framed as a “kickstart” to the human condition, providing a pathway to altered states of awareness that shaped early art, ritual, and cultural practices.
</p>

<p>
<strong>3. The Origins of Consciousness and Art</strong><br><br>
&bull; <em>Primordial Unity:</em> Wilson references Georges Bataille’s idea of an “original order of intimacy,” where humans experienced a unified consciousness with nature, only later disrupted by the development of self-awareness.<br>
&bull; <em>Art as Ritual:</em> The emergence of art is tied to the need to restore balance following the alienation brought about by self-consciousness. Art becomes a mediator between humanity and the world, reflecting the fractured but still connected state of being.
</p>

<p>
<strong>4. The Question of Origins</strong><br><br>
&bull; Wilson critiques the abandonment of origin theories in academia, proposing a “palimpsest” model where multiple theories coexist and illuminate each other. He rejects linear, categorical imperatives in favor of overlapping and intersecting narratives.
</p>

<p>
<strong>5. The Evolution of Society</strong><br><br>
&bull; <em>Hunter-Gatherer Societies:</em> Wilson challenges the narrative of pre-agricultural societies as “nasty, brutish, and short,” presenting them as leisure-rich and deeply connected to their environment.<br>
&bull; <em>Agriculture and the State:</em> He questions why humans transitioned to agriculture and state-based societies, suggesting this shift introduced scarcity, hierarchy, and centralized power at the cost of egalitarian and surplus-based tribal cultures.
</p>

<p>
<strong>6. Paleolithic and Neolithic Transitions</strong><br><br>
&bull; Paleolithic cave art as evidence of complex symbolic thought.<br>
&bull; The Neolithic matriarchal period, characterized by goddess worship and egalitarianism, later supplanted by patriarchal, hierarchical societies.<br>
&bull; The introduction of metallurgy as a key factor in societal transformation.
</p>

<p>
<strong>7. The Role of Mythology</strong><br><br>
&bull; Wilson connects mythology to societal structures, particularly through the recurring motif of the dragon-slaying hero (e.g., Marduk and Tiamat, St. George and the Dragon) as a metaphor for the imposition of order over perceived chaos.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Notable Concepts and Theories</h2></p>
<p>
&bull; <em>“Palimpsest of Origins”:</em> Multiple origin stories (e.g., self-consciousness from fear of death, desire, or psychedelic ingestion) are layered together to create a multidimensional understanding.<br>
&bull; <em>Art as Cognitive and Cultural Evolution:</em> Early art, such as Paleolithic cave paintings, represents a way of “thinking with nature,” merging perception, ritual, and cultural expression.<br>
&bull; <em>Prehistory as a “Golden Age”:</em> Contrasts between the leisure and richness of hunter-gatherer societies and the labor-intensive, hierarchical structure of agricultural societies.<br>
&bull; <em>State Formation as a Breakdown:</em> Pierre Clastres’ theory of “society against the state” frames the rise of the state as a collapse of egalitarian social mechanisms rather than an inevitable progression.
</p>

<p>
<h5>Critical Questions Raised</h5></p>
<p>
&bull; What caused the primordial unity of consciousness to fracture, giving rise to self-awareness and the sacred?<br>
&bull; Why did humanity shift from egalitarian surplus economies to hierarchical, scarcity-driven systems?<br>
&bull; Can the resurgence of interest in neo-shamanism, psychedelics, and ecological thought be seen as a “return of the Paleolithic”?
</p>

<p>
<h5>Implications for Modern Thought</h5></p>
<p>
&bull; The loss and potential recovery of ancient ways of knowing and being.<br>
&bull; The role of art, ritual, and altered states in bridging the gap between modernity and prehistory.<br>
&bull; How interdisciplinary and “outsider” perspectives can challenge rigid academic boundaries to generate new insights.

"the title of the series is plowing the clouds which is a phrase I got somewhere
from Irish folklore now I no longer remember where and I believe it's it was
a sort of metaphor for an impossibility or a futility in other words it's as
hopeless as plowing the clouds so that describes my work in theory and and in
practice but I think it also has another me has another meaning to me and that is
you can plow the clouds you can you can shape you can shape the the luminous and
ephemeral stuff of the imagination you can shape the air there's such a thing
as air art like fire art and Earth art and water art and this then is an
exercise in air art in the airiness of theory everything that I say is pure
hypothesis and purely subjective I'm saying this because there are real anthropologists in the audience in them
I don't want to I don't want to be embarrassingly put into the position of
defending categorical statements which I don't even believe in but I'm simply throwing around in an experimental
fashion to see if any sparks shoot out of those clouds so another aspect of
this work is a sort of at a slant I believe that I'm doing something for for
ethno poetics week with this with these lectures not but by the last lecture I
hope to get around to the origins of poetry but that's going to take a long
time and I may never get there but again
everything that we are going to talk about it seems to me is strongly relevant to the subject of poetics and
and ethno poetics if not in a direct sense than in the sense of what ed
Sanders calls investigative poetics in other words if you I feel that if you're
just writing poetry out of your own pure subjectivity unless you're Dylan Thomas it doesn't
take you very far and to continue the Celtic comparisons it would be better if
you were a sort of a Yeats you know someone who actually studied something be it in his case alchemy or
Celtic folklore or in this case anthropology and archaeology and what's
come to be known is ethno history and various other neologisms of dubious
value but I think you know that that
poetry wants to get its hands into something it wants to dig in the earth and if and and that may even be more
than just a metaphor archaeology and related studies I think are extremely
poetically exciting and in my second lecture I'll tell you about my own
experiences last summer in Wisconsin which I hope to continue this summer in
August where I got my hands on and hands in the dirt for really for the first
time it was always book fantasies for me but last summer I got into a little
amateur archeology and trespassing and being chased by various gothic six-toed
farmers around the cow pastures of Wisconsin you know trying to see various
mounds and petroglyphs and what-have-you and I was in a constant state of ecstasy
the whole time I can't tell you the tiny little discoveries things that we
discovered that we're not in any written source were like it was like pure flashes of LSD you know right straight
to the cerebellum and when I when I try to imagine what the excitement involved
in making a major discovery in archeology like that you know the tomb of Alexander's father or the the gold
hoard of the a communion dynasty or you know some Mayan pyramid that no one ever
noticed before of which I gather there are man
I don't think I could stand it I think I'd expire on the spot so I strongly
recommend every poet to get a sideline in something like this
and really I'm just offering this as an example of the way in which once you get
your hands in the dirt once you read a few books once you've looked at a few pictures and studied a few carbon-dating
x' and so forth and so on you have as much right to your crackpot theory as any archaeologists and anthropologists
as to theirs generally speaking
archaeology is a science which is terrified of interpretation anthropology
is much less guilty in this respect what archaeology has the idea of itself as a science and of course it isn't it's an
art and with with scientific aspects just like any art and so but there's a
kind of paranoid defensiveness on the part of archeology as an academic and professional science in which the wild
interpretations that were given in the 19th century at which which pretty much
all proved to be wrong about the past and especially about prehistory have
been such as such a traumatic experience for archeology that archeologists
nowadays refuse to interpret you know they'll tell you we found three arrowheads seven bones and they were in
such in such a relationship and that's all you know and only only the most
daring or the ones with tenure are the are the ones who dare to interpret who
dare to actually try to imagine what the life of prehistory could have been like
prehistory of course is already a loaded term it implies that somehow we've
evolved from a pre historical state when everything was in Co hate and
incomprehensible and nasty and brutish and short
a stay a superior state of civilized awareness in which time unfolds for us
in a measured and orderly way and in which everything becomes known or will become known and there's a an amnesiac
gulf that this that these kind of attitudes open up between the present in
the past which is not so alien and which which is after all just the past of
human beings of our ancestors there haven't been as even more than a few
hundred generations since the Paleolithic I mean it's really a fly
speck of time in the eyes of the gods and it's not so hard to understand in my
opinion a great deal of what was going on in prehistory of course I say that as
a crackpot you know not as an academic
in in approaching archaeology therefore I believe in in something which
transcends what they now call interdisciplinary Anisa which means that communications are
cautiously open between college departments I would I would like to see
something that might perhaps be called anti categorization ISM take the place
of this interdisciplinary timidity I would like to see all the barriers
between these disciplines broken down or at least breached I'd like to see what
the Russian critic Bakhtin called permeable boundaries divisions which are
kept up for the purposes of discourse in a rational discourse but which are always known to be permeable so that not
only anthropology can be allowed to seep into archaeology and ethno ethnography
into ethno history and history into ethnography and all the various schools
of history can be their findings and methodologies applied to archaeology and all the other
so-called social sciences and this I don't think is going to happen in the
academic world or not very soon I think it and and therefore I do truly believe
even in the moment when I try to overcome my hostility to the whole idea of academic discipline that that we
amateurs we outsiders do have some role to play even if it's only as annoying gadfly's
the English writer John Michell who is certainly not a professional
archaeologist has made great contributions I think just by being open
to everything our astro archaeology in ley lines and any kind of madness as
long as you keep a kind of agnostic approach to this and don't become a true
believer in any of these crackpot theories but are able to drift creatively from theory to theory then I
think that that the the enthusiastic amateur or obsessive amateur has has a
real creative role to play in forcing various academic fortresses to open a
little crack in the portcullis somewhere and let in some various breaths of fresh
air from from other from other disciplines after all it's it's all just humanity
you know it's all just us and there's no reason for these for these amazingly
ridiculous borders which are erected walls fortresses fences fences might
make good neighbors but I don't think it makes for good for good humanitarianism
and in fact Robert Frost was a well-known son of a
so I'm gonna deal with subjects which are pretty much taboo since the 19th
century like the question of origins for example origins are something that
no one wants to talk about anymore all the origin theories the origin of language the origin of art the origin of
consciousness the origin of the indo-european people or the origin of
the megaliths where did it where did these things where do these these things or these peoples come from what was
their origin in the 19th century when these questions were asked origins were seen as as categorical imperatives which
would exclude other origins in other words once you had decided for example that Hebrew was the origin of all
languages because God obviously spoke Hebrew then you could take a wild child
you know and Alphonse Silva would been who had been brought up by wolves in the wild and lock it lock him or her into a
room and and record all the sounds that that the child made and say that this of
course these are all Hebrew roots and therefore the origin of the origin of language is a divine origin and that's
that categorically that's that I would
like to return to the whole question of origins which is again been dumped out of a kind of paranoia or a
disappointment and the failure of these theories to turn up hard scientific data
but instead of viewing origins as categorical imperatives or Thor in other
words absolutes in distinct places along a line of
linear thinking I would like to see I would like to construct a palm obsessed
of origins now palm obsessed if you don't know isn't as a word for an old kind of manuscript where when paper was
expensive people used to write one way across the paper and then they turn the
paper and write another way across the writing and then they'd turn the paper over and do it on the other side and
sometimes there's even more than two scripts on on the same piece of paper so
my palm obsessed is is I see it written on animation gels on on actual
transparent sheaves of paper and I would like to take all these theories that
interest me all these stories about origins and pile them up like a stack of animation gels and then
I'd like to hold them up to the sunlight and see where the light comes through all those all those blobs of black and
this is a kind of cabbalistic approach because the the ancient jewish the old
jewish capitalists used to say that the spaces between the letters were as as significant or perhaps even more
significant than the letters themselves because that's where the divine illumination was coming through so
without making any categorical statements about without giving any origin theory a priority without making
any dogmatic statements about origins or or developments I just like to keep
adding one theory to another and hope at
the end that's as we drift around the
French philosopher Leo Tao has used the term drift work to describe his kind of
philosophy and I find also find this term very congenial as we drift from
theory to theory maybe at least for a moment some illuminations will come
through the study of origins in this way becomes simply another epistemology
simply another way of knowing things and that knowing in itself is not an
absolute that knowing the knowing also drifts from point to point from like a
wave actually rather than like a point and of all of all the origins that we're
interested in of course it's the origin of consciousness which which is the most fascinating you know in other words when
does the animal become the human when is it no longer instinct if that's what
animal thought is and of course that's a deep question in itself and become self
consciousness not even reason but simply awareness of self as self as separate
from all that other and some prominent
answers to that question would be in other words the origin of this what is the origin of this consciousness what is the origin of this
self-consciousness some people would say for example it's fear of death that once
the human brain gets big enough it begins to project thought into into the
future it no longer lives for the moment and as soon as that thought is projected
or even perception is projected a moment into the future then it is possible to become aware of one's own death and
having become aware of one's own death and the obvious inevitability of it and
the obvious meaninglessness of it or let's say the impossibility of its meaning then such thinkers of this
school would say that from that moment on self-consciousness exists and therefore culture exists and therefore
civilization exists and therefore the whole ball of wax but you could also
instead of taking this this death view which by the way is somewhat related to
Freudian thinking although not not precisely you could also take another
leaf from Freud or from the Freudians in general and talk about sexuality as the
origin of consciousness that once a sexuality is separated from instinctual
behavior whatever the hell that might be and you know actually I was looking at
there was a PBS special on the love life of the animals you know sort of and a beast animal porn you know from the PBS
animal porn and the variety of you know the absolutely the stunning variety of
ways of making love that exists in the animal world certainly puts a very big
question mark next to the whole idea of instinct but anyway let's assume that the beasts have instinct and the humans
have something more and that's something more is desire which again is a projection into the future even when the
beloved object or the desired object is absent one desires the the
the person the thing whatever it might be so that so that passion or sexuality
or desire then becomes the the spark the
spark that brings consciousness into being another theory which I which I
like a lot the chief proponent of which at the moment is Terence Mckenna
is that consciousness arose because of the ingestion of psychedelic plants that
and this is this sounds funny you know but when the more I think about it the
more I realized it's certainly a theory that deserves to be layered into that Palme obsessed along with the other
theories to look on it as exclusively true the way Terence does I think gets
you into various kinds of conceptual difficulties but to look on it as also true along with other theories that
makes it to me very very interesting that suddenly restores its interest as a theory so you can imagine that an early
hominid some australopithecine or or Peking man or woman or Java man or woman
or Homo habilis or one of these very very pre human humans if you can think
of them that way in in browsing over various plants not knowing whether it's
good or bad so you know accidentally ingest some psilocybin or Amanita
muscaria or fly agaric or air got or
some other naturally-occurring psychotropic and of course in the new world there there are hundreds of such
such plans to the old world in some ways seems strangely strangely poor in
psychotropic plants but it's certainly not lacking in them and another point
about psychotropic plants is that some of them are only activated by a process they have to be processed in some way
like ayahuasca for example has to have other plants added to it before it
becomes a viable psychotropic so so that in any case I think Tarrant
Terrance's image is that a kickstart was needed for the to the for the human
condition that something needed that the these hominids needed a boot in the ass
to set them on the way of of being human whatever that was going to be and that
some mushroom supplied this kick
then there's the then then there's a theory which I'd like to bring in
tangentially which is the theory of George bataille ba ta il le who in his
book theory of religion and also to a certain extent in the accursed chair
discusses the question of the origins of consciousness and of sexuality and so forth and he speaks of hypothetical
original order of intimacy as what he calls it in other words hypothetically for him at the beginning of human
consciousness there is no separation there's somehow consciousness without separation so that the human condition
has already been reached but there is no self awareness in the sense of self alienation there's no potential cycloid
a psychotic split or abyss yet that has yet opened up within human consciousness
and this is the stage that's referred to in every body of myth or folklore as the time when the gods walked the earth when
when the animals spoke like humans when all the orders of existence were on a
single horizontal plane and in an indirect communication and as you might
say ecological relation with each other and I think bataille as weak point is
that he's unable to just unable to describe or explain why this order of
intimacy should be broken what what would induce what would induce the
doubling of consciousness in a situation like this this surely would be perfection this would be like a
permanent psychedelic state in which one was one was always acting on the basis
of a trend of what we might call a transcendent consciousness which is also imminent at the same time and involved
in in things and within involved in the world in nature so what is it that
causes then what bataille calls the violence of the sacred presumably in in
the under the order of intimacy there is in fact no consciousness of the sacred just as in Bali there is no word for art
but there's but everyone the the artist is not a special kind of person but but
every person is a special kind of artist so also projecting backwards into the
Paleolithic or into the to the origins of humanity wherever they may be or
whenever they may be there is there's also that this also pertains so what
possible shock or catastrophe could have occurred to break that or that original order of intimacy and make future
generations view it as a hideous chaos instead of as the the Golden Age that's
the question or that and many other questions about breaks and Abbas's and separations
it's the question that I'm proposing and I'm not proposing to answer it with any
one single simple minded answer but I want to create a complex web of
references to various theories about this moment this tragic catastrophic
moment which may of course have been extended over centuries or even millennia of time but which appears to
us in retrospect obviously as a moment a crack out of which time and space as two
different things emerge the question the whole quite this this also leads
directly to the whole question of art and writing in the original in the hypothetical original order of intimacy
when the animal spoke to man in the gods gods walked on the earth what would have
been the point of art or writing obviously there would be no point just as all consciousness would be a kind of
Perpetual psychedelic trip or hi so also all all art would be life itself it
would be totally indistinguishable not only would there be no word for it that presumably would even be no words as yet
at all but at some point in the development of the human techne you know
the Greek word for technology techne comes into being and Tecna represents
oddly obviously represents the interface between my consciousness and that world out there now my consciousness is going
to manipulate that world it has taken that work that world for the object and
no longer the subject of its thought formerly is lady Strauss says says you
know animals and plants are good things to think with they're actually processed
yule they're part of a process of thinking so if you look at ancient myth or if you look at the paintings on the
caves of the paintings on the walls of the Paleolithic caves you see a process of thinking with the things of nature in
other words nature is still the subject of the thought to a large extent afterwards as art and as as language
become come into being the this the the split
between the the medium the in-between stage of technique comes into being
now there's something that's in between me when I grasp reality something
interposes between me and that reality is no longer part of me it's a part of some other so this out of this of course
obviously this is the origin of art at this point one one one wishes not only
to manipulate the world but to create beauty in the world because before
everything was beauty so there was no there was no concept of beauty now there's something which is
unbeautiful it's inside its the cycloid split which has occurred this alienation
of self from self and and therefore something needs to be rectified so a
balance needs to be restored so art comes into being ritual comes into being the whole order of the sacred which
includes art now comes into being and this is this is the point at which we
get to let's say to Neanderthal man 40000 to 6062 forty thousand bc
flourished before the last ice age still they're still arguing as to whether a
Neanderthal was homo sapiens sapiens or wise wise man as we like to call
ourselves or whether ananda thaw was some lost branch of evolution that
didn't make it or whether in fact it was a evolutionary precursor to homo sapiens
sapiens or what it's still a mystery oh Neanderthals had bigger brains than
we do this is an interesting point that I talked about last year and if we're
going to talk about evolution then we're going to have to ask why these primitive
creatures had actually bigger brains bigger brains what did they need those extra brains for very curious my own my
own poetic fancy is that they needed bigger brain because their perceptual world was so
much bigger than ours that that they were still closer to this order of
intimacy and therefore the myriad things the ten thousand things as the Chinese
say were were we're much more perceivable much more perceived by them
and if you for example if you visit a South American tribe now you'll find
that you walk through a jungle with them I mean I haven't done this myself but I've read wonderful descriptions of it
you walk through a jungle and they see everything that the the forest is a book for them it's a text they know what
everything is they call forth everything they evoke everything they live with everything and you're seeing what you
know a hellish a hellish green chaos of
perception which out of which nothing appears to you is meaningful so assuming
that that that old Neanderthal was closer to that world in a way which even
our modern tribal people can no longer be there was there were many many many
more things that Neanderthal had to think with this is a strange way of
looking at things because we feel that civilization of course has created the many many many things and before that
there was only a kind of brutal brutal simplicity you know what John Michell calls the word doom height theory of
humanity that human beings were originally stupid and only recently became clever you know which is a very
very unsatisfactory theory to me because when well you know this has to be said
as stupid as it may sound because this is still to a large extent orthodoxy
within within the archaeological world when I see the burial sites for example
of the Neanderthal which is just about all we can recover of their culture I
don't feel this this brutal stupidity I feel something very very profound
there's a wonderful dig in in Iraq that I've read about called the Cave of the flowers which is a Neanderthal burial
where a pollen analysis was made of the dust in the graves I
forget the name of the woman who did this it was a brilliant thing and it was
discovered that the burials had been made with with heaps and heaps of flowers and herv's had been piled into
the grave on top of the bodies or underneath the bodies and that some of these plants she was all able to
identify them all and many of them turned out to be plants which are still used in Iraq in that region today as
medicinal or magical plants so here's a cultural continuity going back to what
40,000 BC which speaks directly to us because I've actually lived in that part
of the world and used those herbal remedies so that was a direct contact between me and and and the brilliance of
Neanderthals the use of red ochre in graves already begins with Neanderthal
and continues right up to the present it ochre is the perhaps the original
religious symbol red earth was put into the graves to perhaps to symbolize blood
as the blood is the life perhaps to symbolize light as in the red the red
sunlight but obviously having a whole complex of life like symbolism connected
with it and indicating some people would say indicating already a belief in immortality or a belief in the
continuance of some kind of life beyond the grave so religion in toto the whole
ball game already there long before crow Manion long before modern man as a
matter of fact just as a footnote somebody I guess it was Andrew was talking at the panel yesterday about
writing and he dated it as beginning as we've all been taught to see writing as
having begun in the in the late Neolithic in Mesopotamia which is
already very very late in the story of prehistory in fact it's the end of the story because once writing comes along
and succeeds then history begins but first of all the the scholar Maria
gambit us has our the our who was a wonderful archaeologist I'll be referring to her work a lot has already
discovered that the early Neolithic seventh millennium in the Balkan
northern Greek and Balkan and western Anatolian regions that these mmm
societies which she describes very very early Neolithic far far far earlier than
Mesopotamia or Egypt already had developed some kind of a symbolic system
of course we can't we can't decipher it at all although she made some very very
interesting stabs at doing so but her arguments a bit basically lead to lead
to the conclusion that writing writing itself is far far older than we believed and in fact is prehistoric and then
Alexander Marshak another great archaeologist with a real vivid imagination traces notation at
least if not writing way back into the Stone Age even into the Paleolithic on a
number of objects which he identified which had never been studied before
because they were so embarrassing and impossible to understand their objects
which have scratches on them and they're obviously not decorative I mean they're not at all interesting to look at some
of them are very worn as if they've been carried around in somebody's pocket or
used over a long period of time and they have little Nick's or scratches or marks in them and no one had ever asked what
these things meant until Marshak came along and suddenly saw them as a form of notation because of course according to
the or doom height theory these people were too stupid to do something like that the so therefore ergo you know
these these things were meaningless or perhaps decorative but basically meaningless Marshak asked if they might
not be note note note ative and he started counting the scratch marks and adding them up and seeing where they
were divided and over and over and over again he began finding numbers which related to the lunar cycle
30:28 numbers like that and sevens 28
numbers like that and so he hypothesized and wrote a wrote a great deal and
extremely painstakingly careful work to propose his theory that that these were
in fact the origins of calendrical mathematics and that for reasons unknown
but perhaps understandable or recoverable through ethnography that these Paleolithic hunters were already
interested in the calendar which was previously thought to be an eel with the convention dependent upon agriculture or
perhaps giving rise to agriculture and having nothing to do with hunting with the hunting societies so every every
every origin can be pushed back that's the only point I'm trying to make here all the origins can be pushed back pushed back pushed back and you begin
with a as I as I did with a fascination with with early classical societies like
Greece and Mesopotamia and then you push you start you start going back under under every fact a trapdoor opens and
drops you down down down into an archeology of time you know and you
discover that all those layers are still present none of none of this has vanished and I'm not talking just about
archaeological stratigraphy although that's part of it within every
consciousness there is and remains a hunter-gatherer consciousness or a peasant Neolithic peasant consciousness
we are we are all still those people it's only been just the mirrors briefest
time since we were not those people and in fact secretly we are still those
people we have links strong links of
consciousness which connect us to those people and which have been denied vigorously hysterically rigidly denied
ever since the rise of civilization ever since the rise of civilization in the
Fertile Crescent or whatever you want to call it actually was northern Anatolia well get
that later you as soon as we have a mythology to look at its a mythology of
denial of denial of this connection it's a mythology which tells us that those ancient people were chaotic and
evil and bad and that we the agriculturalists with the priests and the Kings and the storehouses full of
grain we're the good guys and those primitives those primitive tribes people those are the bad guys those are the
avatars of chaos and we are the avatars of order and so history itself is
founded on it on a on a total dualism on this dichotomy on this on a split which
was perceived to have taken place in time between a primitive chaos and this
this theory as I say as has been identified with the the line that the
life of primitive man is nasty brutish and short as who was it Locke Hobbes said so this has
been the point of view ever since Mesopotamia arose itself from the from
the slime of prehistory and it remains the the ideology of today obviously
otherwise we would we as a culture would not still be engaged in desperately trying to wipe out every last vestige of
the Paleolithic on the on one on one level I mean we heard from all the we
heard all the eek eeeek stories from the panel the other day about how this language is disappearing and that tribe
is disappearing and this is not this is this is not a joke this is happening on
the other hand we right now are living through what I would call a return of
the Paleolithic and I'll get to that later but by that I mean that nothing disappears and finally now after all
these centuries certain weights have been lifted from our consciousness civilization itself has failed so
miserably in certain respects anyway that we we are we have regained our
vision of this prehistoric past and we've reinterpreted it now we have a new interpretation of it and that's why we
have neo shamanism and neo-paganism and green-green philosophies and guyun
philosophies and ecological activism all those all those kinds of forces in
modern society are coming out of what I read what I call not a return to the Paleolithic no one wants to bomb
themselves back to the Stone Age but a return of the Paleolithic I'll get also
hope I hope to return to that so anyway these dichotomies are set up order and
chaos cultivated in wild st. George and the dragon that's a good example which
which can be traced back to one of the very earliest Babylonian myths of Tiamat and Marduk Tiamat was the dragon or
rather the dragon s she was the earth mother her progeny were monsters and she
had to be removed from from heaven by
Marduk who was the the male phallic patriarchal God by contrast anyway the
warrior priests King God who slaughters the female Tiamat who's symbolic of
water and chaos and shapelessness and cuts her up into little pieces and out
of those pieces human beings are created and so human beings are the the carrion
gobbets of carrion from the dead body of the of the matriarchal dragon and human
beings are created for one purpose and one purpose only by by this act of Marduk and that is to work for the
priests and kings to fill up the temples with grain so that there will be wealth
for the priests and kings it says so go read it in the book you know I'm not making this up that's what the myth says
and I've you know I take it quite literally st. George has pinned down
dragons all over Europe if you go travel around Europe from church to church wherever there's a church dedicated to
st. George there's a dragon underneath with a lance through it sticking it into the earth whereas st. George pinned it
down and in this way the Marduk consciousness st. George is definitely
Marduk the Marduk consciousness by pinning down these
actually creates the landscape of culture before there was only chaos only
wilderness only forests only with what the Cuban Cuban magicians call El Montay
the forest and mountain combined into one concept the wildness the out there
which is not us and by by slaying the
representative of that other naswinger a snake and painting it down st. George
actually creates the landscape of Europe this is called LAN na ma LAN de nama in
some Scandinavian language I think Swedish I'm not sure Danish Icelandic
thank you this is the actual emergence of cultured
landscape out of nothingness out of supposed chaos now of course as I said before it's not chaos for the tribal
hunter who lives who lives inside it the forest the rainforest is not chaos to
the in bootie pygmies you know it's their it's their home it's their texts it's their it's their everything they
have no concept of a cultivated space separated from this forest no concept of
an other place or an other time they're still as it were not only living in dream time but in dream space but for
for the modern consciousness which begins already with Babylon just like
the just like the Bible implies for modern consciousness which begins with
these Mesopotamian civilizations is a process precisely of created they look
on it as actually creating the earth this is why if you read about if you read the mythologies of these people
this is a process of creation Marduk creates human beings before that there were no human beings there were only
wild monsters who inhabited the forests and in Gilgamesh you know the character
of Enkidu who comes down this is the first epoch of the human race if you haven't read it I strongly recommend it
Gilgamesh was the great king and the mardukan figure in the tale his best
friend is Anki who comes from the mountains in other words from El Montay from the forests from the wilds wild place and he is an
hairy man as the Bible says of some character or another he's he's a hairy
fella he's a sort of a sasquatch character and he comes down out of the
mountains because Gilgamesh tempts him with a woman desire tempts him to become
civilized and then he and he and Gilgamesh fight a terrible battle and
afterwards they become the best of friends so there's that so this eventually of course no culture could
survive forever with the schizophrenic split going on all the time this intense rigid consciousness of fences and
fencing off of space I mean it would just be too psychotic so there's always a reconciliation that occurs one you
first a split into two first a separation a thesis and antithesis if you like and then using a galilean
terminology a synthesis or as I would prefer to say a dialectical reconciliation between these terms and
so the wild is absorbed into the civilized and the power of the wild is used and understood sometimes it
involves a contract or a contact with the remnants of the wild people who live
out in the woods sometimes their magic is more powerful than our magic and we if we civilized ones want to oh I don't
know be cured of some dread disease or put a spell on our wife then we go to
the old sorceress of the forest you know the one the witch who lives on the other side of the clearing if you read
fairytales about witches they're always on the other side of the clearing and so
the the remnants of the wild people remain remain necessary actually once
the last indigenous tribe is erased from this earth if that's going to happen
that will be the Millennium that will be the end because without that without
that existent consciousness of the wild then the existent consciousness of
cultivation and of culture will die it will lose its root and even if this root
is is surrounded by images of violence it is it's still legitimately there so we're
looking at a gradual process of separation I don't believe that we can take one moment in time and say oh that
was it you know if we could only go back before that moment you know be it the
1960s or or you know the Paleolithic I
think there's a spectrum of moments there's a continuity of moments there's a chaos of moments there's a moment that
occurs over and over again and it's always a moment of separation and the separation is always new in its
terminology new and it's in its terms but never new in its structure and that's why the same old dragon myth the
same old myth of the Dragon Slayer
same myth gets trotted out again and it's still going on if you just pick up
a newspaper and see the way oh let's say the way the Arabs are depicted in in our
or the Moslems in general or depicted in our society yeah I wouldn't be surprised if you found the term snake worshipers
used at some point for you know they they at present are the wild other that
were that we're dealing with in their own minds of course they're highly civilized people you know in fact more
civilized than us but that's another matter so where let's say we want to
identify some of these key points or ambiguous moments of separation when
when some order of intimacy is broken and replaced by an order of separation
we might for example go back to the Ice Age now it's an interesting fact that
amongst hunter-gatherer societies which and I should point out by the way for those of you who may not know that for I
would say 95% of its existence as a as an entity humanity has been involved in
hunting and gathering as an economy it's only the last five percent which
involves pastoralism and agriculture and industry so it's an interesting fact
that amongst all the hunter-gatherer societies we can look at now gathering
is much more important than hunting and gathering of course is the province of the women hunting is the province of the
men this is almost universal but the hunting as it turns out and this is from
a very nice collection of essays called man the hunter came out in 1968 I forget
the editor but it was a whole it was interesting that it came out in 1968 because it I think that this whole idea
of the hunter plays into the whole psychedelic movement in the
rebellion of the 1960s but the finding was that gathering is much much much
more important economically the hunting is prestigious the hunting is exciting
it's adventurous secret societies are formed around it rituals are formed around it religions are formed around it
as you can see if you look at the cave paintings in Europe which are 99%
depictions of animals so the figures
range of amongst modern tribes from 10% hunting to 90% gathering amongst some
African tribes to a more even balance amongst the Eskimos of course the Eskimos are up in a you know in a part
of the world where hunting would obviously be much more important than gathering and the large part of the
Eskimo diet is meat because that's what there is to eat and only I think only
about 30% of Eskimo diet it comes from gathering so we could project backwards
here's a place where ethnology could throw light on archaeology we could project backwards to those Neanderthals
as the ice age begins to creep up on them the verb glaciation the last big Ice Age and presumably they had some
sort of gender egalitarianism our days
that original human society original there's that word again original human
society was a gender egalitarian society it may have been matriarchal in the
strict sense of the word that is that descent was marked through the female
line because before marriage is invented you don't know who the father is so clearly if you're going to have any
idea of kinship at all it has to be based on the female but this doesn't necessarily mean that there was some
kind of society of of huge strong women lording it over kind of you know
supernumerary men it's much much easier to see for example that hunting arose in
prestige precisely to Bali to rectify an imbalance that would have occurred because gathering was
economically so much more important and because kinship was traced through the woman through the female that hunting
would have been maybe the the prestige of hunting the cult of hunting may have been a response to that that imbalance
but then comes along the Ice Age and the whole thing is thrown into a new imbalance now hunting which gave itself
prestige has actually now become economically more important than gathering and so a terrible imbalance
may have occurred in the and earth all society in fact that may be why they disappeared but the same imbalance would
hold true for us too because we modern Homo sapiens emerge out of the Ice Age I
mean that's where we first see ourselves is emerging out of the ice I think that's why that frozen fella in the
Swiss Alps has been so fascinating to everybody everyone sees their origin and this frozen corpse
so this theory would go on to explain that men therefore men in the Ice Age
achieved an unfair balance of power in society and therefore once the ice went
away women who still remembered how to gather began to really push it as a new
a new economy and they began to say aha you know we're now where the power and and the gradually this pushing of
gathering and the returning every year to sites where I say certain wild grasses or fruits were found and the
discovery that you could recede those areas on purpose that this intense new
activity of the women created the beginnings of Agriculture and that therefore another flip-flop now takes
part in takes place in human society and once again and and once again women are
on top and the matriarch the the famous Neolithic matriarchy the age of the
goddess which we now switch we now know so much about although we may not know very much accurate data about comes into
being and Gimbert us in her Maria Ginn butas GIM bu TAS in her book
civilization of the God which is uh not only in print but remaindered so I advise you to rush out
and get it it's got the the most beautiful photographs of just about any book on the neolithic i'ma she she
photographs stuff that nobody else apparently dared to photograph because it would have screwed up their theories
endless endless Neolithic goddesses of all kinds you know just overwhelming
evidence it's like 95% of all the mobile art found in the Neolithic is statues of
goddesses and only less than 5% is the little phallic consort deity of the
goddess the the male as consort of the goddess and goes along with it and
therefore so the could continue with this gender war theory of human development at the end of the Neolithic
with with the introduction of a new techne metals which are which are
apparently brought in from the east by the according to Jim butis by the by the
proto-indo-europeans the the corgin people that is to say most of us the the
indo-aryans whatever you want to call him brought in bronze and this made this
made yet another this created yet another rebalancing effect on human society and of course since metallurgy
was very very magical it involved
digging into the body of Mother Earth and in a much more intrusive way even than agriculture and therefore has
always been surrounded and is still surrounded with intense taboo and has
been largely a province of men and so metallurgy then changes the balance once
again and now we have the image of the great patriarchal 'lest societies of the
early Classical period the Greeks the Mesopotamians the Marduk and Zeus
worshipers the sky God people that big nobodaddy phallus lightning bolt in the
sky and men take over and the king replaces the queen and now the goddess
is the consort of the God not the other way around and the Neolithic goddess
survives but gets smaller and smaller and more and more creepy until finally
she becomes Hecate the witch goddess and a principle of evil which goes right
back again to the idea of Tiamat as feminine principle as a principle of water being the evil chaotic principle
while the male principle which is of light as opposed of day as opposed to
night light as opposed to darkness strength as opposed to weakness all
these all these mythic dichotomies come into play and we have a new propaganda in the world the propaganda of the
fathers as opposed to the propaganda of the mothers well it's a very clever neat
theory but I I certainly don't think it's a categorical imperative
I'm not adopting it as dogma for one thing it's it's way oversimplified it's
like a Punch and Judy show for another thing there's too much actual hard data
in the way of it and for another thing I just don't like it you know even if it
was true I would reject it however I don't think it's useless I don't think
it's a useless theory by any means and if I were to take in Buddhists as the major representative of this theory I
would you know I would actually bow down to this woman because why because even
though she's a professional archaeologist she dares to have an interpretation she actually dared to
have an opinion about what things were like in prehistory instead of just saying well we found 18 figurines of
plump god of plump female figures not goddesses you know or at least we don't
know for sure maybe it was primitive pornography and it can't be sure that's why I call the ark rum theory of the
Neolithic goddess you know
that at least at least she dared to construct a theory and we can bounce off
it you know we can have a conversation now what a relief we're no longer being stiff-armed by these academics who said
sorry you don't have any right to interpret that because we're experts and even we don't know what it means you
know well I I know somebody who used to work with jim buddhist and he said that in the day time she would be on the dig
behaving like just like a good scientific archeologist but at night she would take one of the plump female
figures and go back and sit in the moonlight and listen to it you know so this is like this lovely this lovely
attack from both sides that she gives us not only the scientific but the intuitive not only not only the the dry
academic work in the dust which she makes very exciting by the way but also that nighttime intuition you know the
realm of as he's odd said chaos eros gaia and old night so that's that's her
theory but i don't want to oversimplify you should go read her stuff it's not
this i'm not trying to make her into some kind of avatar of vulgar feminism
here far from it there are people who have used her work in that way but that's not her fault so that's one
theory now we could go we could talk about we could talk about other theories
and i'm just gonna come come across them as i go along what we're looking for
always is the again is the break the split the abyss that opens up in consciousness between the tribe the the
old egalitarian tribal gender egalitarianism well surplus and scarcity
you know it's a fact that the hunters may know hunger but hunters do not know scarcity
a hunter can die of hunger but a hunter does not die of scarcity that scarcity
in surplus that dichotomy comes into being with agriculture and here we come
to one of my favorite books Stone Age economics by Marshall Sahlins sah Li NS
salyanz' was particularly offended as an anthropologist by the nasty brutish and
short theory of primitive man all those words in quotes please and he set out to
do a statistical analysis of all the fieldwork he could get a could gather concerning work and food gathering
amongst existent hunting gathering societies I think he found 14 or 15 of
them and he pointed out that these are people like the Bushmen the pygmies the
the Eskimos who have been pushed out to
the margins to the bare bare margins of viability in this world I mean we
powerful uh you know agricultural industrial types took all the good land and all that's left for these folks is
the tundra or the steppe or the desert or what-have-you so right away you would think if
anyone's leading a nasty brutish short life it must be these folks so he went
and collected all the data that he could about the amount of time spent in food
gathering by these people and then he compared it to another statistical analysis that he made of primitive
agriculturalists societies slash-and-burn types and found out how
many hours a day they had to work and I don't remember that I may get the may be getting the figures wrong but it was
something like this the hunter-gatherers average 4.2 hours a day work and that
means a lot of them work even less than that the primitive agriculturalists average 14 hours a day work the larder
that is the number of foodstuffs No to primitive primitive hunters he found
averaged out to about 200 200 different things to eat the larder of the
agricultural society is averaged up to 20 things 1/10 of the menu for the for
the agriculturalists so the idea that agriculture came into being because human beings were tired of eating bugs
you know and it was kind of a queue liam culinary explanation of the rise of
Agriculture doesn't hold true the diet of the hunter-gatherers was far more complex
it was far much more of a cuisine than a mere cookery and in fact there's a
wonderful myth which I think's alland a wonderful story about our about anthropology that Sahlins I believe this
is where I got it he says that there was a tribe of Australian Aborigines who
appear in the original literature is very nasty brutish and short and the reason is the the the clue to this is
that every year they walk over a hundred miles through the desert to get to a place where there's some fallen trees
and pry off the bark and eat these grubs so any any people that does that must
really be desperate right so later on and other anthropologists went and
actually deigned to ask the people themselves what they were doing and they
said something like this well we have nothing better to do at this time of year and we love to do to go walkabout
you know this phrase walkabout they just love to wander through that we love to wander through the desert and we get
that to this place and boy wait'll you taste those witchetty grubs mmm hmm you know it's like it's like as
if we would say and then I went to the Riviera and I lived on caviar for a week now this is this is this is this and so
Salmons developed this kind of anecdotal and statistical material into a picture of
primitive of Stone Age economy the title of the book which he was then able to
coin the term the original leisure society to describe this actually I
don't like the word leisure anymore it has too many negative connotations from TVland but let's think of it as the
original the original society of excess of just having far more than anybody
could ever want or need and and if you study let's say the Northwest Indians the people up around Washington and
Oregon or the what you can recover of knowledge about the Indians who lived
for example let's say around the Chesapeake Bay where you know they probably worked about on the average I
would say about a half an hour a day on food work took up about a half an hour per day of the life of a people like
that where do you think all that fantastic art came from amongst the Northwest Coast Indians they had time they had
leisure they had time to devote themselves to a amazing explosion or
excess of creativity and Bataille talks about this too by the way in the occur
seed share he talks about how a society which experiences excess not scarcity
but excess will have to blow it off in some dramatic way you know and for
example the potlatch would be the way in which the Northwest Indians blew it off every once in a while some rich person
would say I hereby challenge you know the whole society I'm gonna prove myself the most generous dude within you know
50 mile radius I'm gonna give away everything you know and hold a big party
and I just saw a wonderful show on this at the Museum in Seattle the soup bowls
the size of this twice the size of this table and spoons there weren't ladles
they were spoons for each each person got one of these spoons to to dish up
this candle fish oil which was a great delicacy for them I can't imagine what it was like but when you live in a cold
climate you get into that greasy greasy food you know and they just spent all their time doing this until until we we
quote we arrived and blew the whole scene and finally actually made the potlatch illegal you know up until a few
years ago the potlatch was a crime and it had to be practiced underground
and and so the whole the whole practice of potlatch got distorted by by contact
with the Europeans but originally it was an expression of social excess and just a sort of bounteous exuberance of
overdoing it and this is why so-called
primitive peoples have these a blowout you know when something is in season they go where that thing is in season
and they eat themselves sick and they you know dance themselves ragged and
they make love and they have fun and it happens a lot you know happens quite
frequently even in the Middle Ages there were still 111 official holidays in
Europe a third of the year off and what
is that now twelve down to down to twelve official holidays a year in this country I think so I'd like to I'd like
to leave that as just a just a point that you should keep in mind as I continue to talk about the Stone Age
that we are not talking about the nasty brutish and short we're talking about a
great culture which is not yet a civilization and therefore is very hard for us to recognize as a culture but
it's a great culture and it is a culture of permanent excess this is my
interpretation the the reason why the folks in France spent all that time
decorating caves was because they were so well fed and happy that they wanted to do art all the time
I think it's an impulse that we could all recognize or at least dream about in
I think it was 1876 or somewhere around that date anyway a French writer I don't
know what I think he was actually an archaeologist stumbled by mistake into
one of the painted caves in France this anecdote is recounted by Marshak but I've forgotten the details and he wrote
later on in his diary there seemed to be some dobbs of colored something smeared on the wall he
couldn't see it he could not understand that it was art what it appeared to him
as was just rubbish on the wall and this
is exactly like those famous so-called primitive tribes who can't recognize a photograph when they see it you may have
heard about this I remember these stories from my childhood pictures of guys with bones and their noses holding
a photograph upside down you know it's like oh they don't understand photographs how primitive well this French savant in the late 19th
century could not understand that Lascaux is the greatest work of art in Europe you know or at least one of them
he couldn't see it we couldn't see it until very very recently the entirety of
prehistory as we now understand it is a very recent discovery and it began with
a few discs sort of disgusted English and German and French gentlemen who
really thought that that the primitive things were kind of disgusting but they didn't have anything better to do so
they would mess around and look at these things people like James Fraser in folklore the Golden Bough you know who
actually hated all the stuff he wrote it about or at least so he said thought it was evidence of dumb height you know the
of how stupid people were before the British came along to correct them but
nevertheless he dabbled in it for 12 huge volumes you know and so
beginning with those kind of people who could sort of half see they could sort
of half see by focusing through a binoculars made out of classical literature which of course Greek Greek
the Greek classics contain innumerable clues about the so called pre historical
period they could begin to reach back or back off and there's a wonderful example contemporary and friend of Nietzsche
wrote the book on mother right invented the whole concept of matriarchy or rather reinvented it as far as I can
make out thought that the matriarchal period was up was it was a scandal that it would involved a lot of men who
were being dominated by women and spending all their time screwing around I mean literally you know orgies
culture of orgy asta sysm it's the way he saw it and he thought that the real
Helene's you know the real Greeks the real patriarchal people represented the this great step forward in social
evolution to get rid of the female to get rid of the cough onic to get rid of the the Paleolithic the dragon them the
mothers the water and replace it with this you know a wonderful image of the
of Greece as the as the epitome of reason and bare white stones we forget
that those temples were painted like Hindu temples you know and that the statues were painted like Hindu like the
statues in Hindu temples and that even these great Helene's who were so patriarchal and masculine and platonic
and everything themselves were far closer to what we would consider wild-ass paganism you know than we can
ever imagine so back off and burrowing back through that wild-ass paganism recovered the
matriarchy and he thought it was awful he was shocked actually I think he had
mixed feelings sometimes he kind of liked it you know how how can you
dislike the orgy after all but he couldn't admit it it would have been you know Paco me old foe in the Victorian
era to actually admit to a nostalgia for the for this matriarchal orgy asta sysm
and his work was taken up by by the has been taken up and reinterpreted by by
some smart feminists students of prehistory including Jim Buddha's so it
should now I would like to shift the focus of the question now and question
the origin of the state and we've talked about how for millions and millions of
years human beings live in a state of the Galit Aryan surplus economy hunting
and gathering goes on for million millions after millions of years and no one ever thinks to change it
this of course from the point of view of progress and evolution looks like degeneracy however from the from the
point of view of from the sort of post-postmodern point of view which views civilization as a mixed blessing
at best this Paleolithic past begins to look more and more like the Golden Age
begins to look like a very good thing now politically the the kind of tribal
structure that we're talking about is not and cannot be considered as the state and in fact archaeologists and
archaeologists no longer consider that it was such that there was in those days such a thing as the state society yes of
course there was society human society itself begins with that original moment of splitting apart which immediately
then demands its its antithesis and it coming together so I think you if you
want to ask the origins of human society it is also in that mythical moment of
falling apart of of the split the primordial split of consciousness but
the state is something that comes much much much much much much much much much much much later only a few minutes ago
really and it arose in the as in the
form that we know it now pretty much in the Neolithic I think in the late Neolithic and if you look at at a place
like chattel hoyuk which is at a small this in fact the first city in the world
as far as we know it's in Anatolia Turkey and it was dug up I think in the
late 50s or early 60s and has still not been paid very close attention to and it
turned out to be a town with streets laid out in a grid pattern like New York
it's a sea with a cedilla sign underneath sea
ial hu why UK and I think what's the
name of the guy who worked on that Mellaart anybody know James Mellaart
yeah Emmy ll a RT I think so this this
alright now we're faced with another mystery first of all we had the mystery of gender then we had the mystery of
agriculture why would anybody want to give up hunting and gathering for such a shitty deal as agriculture and now we
have to ask ourselves about the state why would anybody give up egalitarian society which persisted well into the
Neolithic according to Kim Buddhist and I'm perfectly willing to believer a society which moreover has revealed
almost no signs of warfare or violence as we understand it there's no human
sacrifice to be found in the Paleolithic and early Neolithic no evidence of cannibalism or some people think there
is but I disagree I have a different interpretation of all of that material and warfare begins with the Bronze Age
and eventually and seems to coincide with the invention of the state as a
means of organizing society now what
earthly reason could there been to give up at what I call a million years of anarchy in favor of this tight-assed
form of order in which a few people of course are in a much better position
than ever the kings and priests but most of us are beginning that long history of
work consumed died y-you know what was in it for us for
Christ's sake why should we have ever adopted agriculture why should we have ever adopted the state all the old
evolutionist views that these were steps forward that agriculture would of course
provide more food and better food and that the state would protect people
against violence what violence you know but don't ask there's violence out there
in the forest I can feel it why who where did this was this a scam
are we gonna have like oh how about the conspiratorial theory of history you know an elite which bands together to
enslave the rest of humanity and constructs out of nothingness a new
religion based on on the idea that you are nothing but a piece of dead flesh
cut off from the primordial dragon and that is your duty to do nothing but
slave for the priests and the king and to fill up that storehouse with grain to make that surplus on one hand and that
scarcity on the other you are in the scarcity king is in the surplus yeah
what caused this what on earth could have caused this the French anthropologist Pierre class trace CLA
stres has two books which are very germane to this question one is called
society against the state and that one I don't know whether it's in print or not
but you should certainly seek it out it's a masterpiece and the other one which just came out recently and I'm
proud to say the publishing company that I'm associated with autonomy dia got to
publish the English version of the book that class dress was working on when he unfortunately died and didn't finish
called the archaeology of violence in these two books Colossus puts forward a
theory that society itself is a structure which is meant to resist the
emergence of the state it's not just that people were you know happily going along bumbling along through the whole
Paleolithic and they never thought of it you know they never thought oh you know we could enslave all these people and
make them work for the thought occurred countless times to countless sons of throughout the
entire meet probably occurred to the the second australopithecines you know that he could enslave the first and make him
work for him I mean it's a very old idea but it never worked and a class dress
doesn't give this by the way this fantasy about the past he sticks strictly to his fieldwork amongst the
granny granny Indians of South America
but I'm extrapolating I'm making I'm making the extrapolation later on in his book work on primitive war he did begin
to extrapolate back into the past and I'll get to that in a minute so class
stress sees society itself as a defense against these sons of who come
along from time to time and try to invent the state everybody knows this happens you can find stories about it in
in the mythology and in in you can work in comparative mythology and separate
this out as an actual motif in folklore we've always known that these potential kings and priests were around but we've
resisted them apparently and class dress looks at the at the tribal societies he
studies and he sees many of the social institutions in a new light because of this theory and so he rejects leve
Strauss and all the earlier work which he's which he is in part based on and comes to a new theory about a primitive
society that it is in fact a kind of freedom machine if I can put it that way that's my phrase not his it's an actual
mechanism for the preservation of social freedoms and that these things are very well understood at least on the level of
folklore or mythology by that by the society is in common and then in his
second in the second book which as I say he unfortunately never finished called the archeology of violence he began to
develop this theory he bent began to focus in on the question of war warfare now gimm Buddhist points out that
there's very little evidence of warfare all the way up through the Neolithic there's no fortified settlements there
are no huge caches of weapons there are very very few examples of skeletons you can find that seemed to
have been victims of violence or murder just and if you look at so-called primitive tribes you find the same thing
there's very little evidence for organized continual violence that we
call warfare amongst so-called primitive people in fact the last surviving
example of this I think might be the wonderful Yanomami money that the the
wildest what the wildest tribe and wildest ass tribe in the world I think and they have just continually resisted
the the onslaught of civilization and they do it because they're like if you took the Hells Angels and dropped them
in the middle of the jungle and came back 5,000 laterz years later that would be that would be these people they're I
mean they're really wonderful I really admire them and they're completely given over to violence it's their entire way
of life revolves around violence they have these on the slightest excuse they
take these clubs out and start bashing each other over the head there's a wonderful ethnographic film
apparently Steven Taylor saw it I haven't seen it of some when Samantha Rose who were fortunate enough to be in
the village on the day one of these fights broke out and and and and you know with their jaws hanging to their
knees filmed this going on incredible violence and the the first anthropologist who really studied them
Napoleon Chanyeol has had a one of the classic anecdotes of modern anthropology
he went as a young anthropologist he went to study these people and they just
gave him continually they just they they laughed at him they wouldn't answer his questions they stole his food right
in front of his face they pushed him around they made fun of him constantly
and he was the saddest little anthropologist in the world you know he
just the whole he saw his whole career going up in in smoke from these sons of who won't pay attention you know
and one day at the lowest point of his depression he's sitting in his Hut he has one can of sardines left and the
lowest guy on the you know pecking order in the in the some who everybody else laughs
at comes into his tent kicks him out of the way and steals his last can of sardines it's the last straw you know
and he loses it and he rushes after this guy and in front of the whole tribe he
starts pounding on it give me back my sardine juice I'm a and
after that the elders of the tribe come up to him and and say gee you know sorry
man we didn't know you were human
now warfare amongst these people is clearly not a force for centra potala t
you know for moving in towards the center and towards ever more severe forms of social order warfare amongst
folks like this is centrifugal it just scatters every social force to the winds
it dissipates it's again it's a form of excess it's a form of working off that excess of the stuff Stone Age economy
this time in the form of violence and of course it involves the expenditure of great amounts of wealth to do this you
have to raise up a troop of your friends and you go and you have this adventure and you have to leave your fields behind
Jack you can't do any hunting I mean by their standards it's very expensive so it's a form of waste they waste the
excess and this means through primitive warfare and right up until very recently
the examples of the the pictures of war that we get from let's say even the
Plains Indians of the 19th century is it still very much this way it's it's not a
warfare which is aimed towards the creation of a state in other words towards the in the conquering and
enslaving of an entire people it's a dissipative warfare it it spreads
itself out in every direction and it's really actually not that violent one of the big problems that the Plains Indians
tribes faced when they first came in contact with the Europeans was that counting coup was considered to be far
groovier thing to do than killing somebody if you could take your coup stick which was a symbolic weapon that
couldn't be used to hurt a fly really and get close to one of the enemy on poni and touch him and insight of
everybody who touched him and then get away leave the guy alive but his face is completely gone he's been touched and
counting coup was far more sophisticated in really cool way for the warrior to to
to act than to actually kill somebody which is really messy and kind of crude you know so but unfortunately the
Europeans didn't understand this and they even even after they were touched
with the coup stick they would just go right on firing with that damn fire stick you know and wiping out the the
Warriors who had done that the really brave thing who had counted coup so this
this is primitive warfare it is not repeat underlined not war as
civilization knows war according to class race if I read him correct because
the the essay breaks off at the point that he died and he promised that he was going to go on and analyze what could
cause these social structures to break down and give way to the state he was he
was he was actually going to try to answer the question of the origin of the state and I think he was going to find
that origin in a breakdown of the primitive warfare structure in that
there would be there would come a point at which inadvertently almost primitive
warfare would result in the conquest and enslavement of another tribe and therefore the creation of a class
structure in that in order to manage that class structure the state would
have to arise so that's actually again it's really not explanatory because why
did that accident occur nevertheless it's it's very close to being an explanation and it's it's a very
interesting concept so now we have the
state we have social hierarchy we have property because also the ideas of
personal problem I doing for time what time is it it's I have five minutes
well so I will just arbitrarily break off here now because I want to leave some time for for questions I didn't
realize it was so late someone has to get the hook out for me you know and okay so wait a minute let me just
remember where we are here I own about got about two fifths done of my first
lecture here no no okay but at this
point let's let's leave it at that the mystery of the rising of the state and next time I actually hope to focus in on
an example of a fascinating example which again has to do with my studies in
Wisconsin last summer of a society which apparently moved backwards through this
supposed developmental system who were at one time agriculturalists but who gave it up to go back into the woods and
become hunters and gatherers again and what role psychedelics played in that
story and what role economics played in that story what role art played and so
forth and so on and I will have to rush through the rest of my introductory material in order to get into this
fascinating example of a hunter-gatherer society which created some of the most beautiful art in America the effigy
mounds of Wisconsin so if there are
questions I will certainly be happy to entertain them yeah
I was wondering if you thought the fall
myth in the Bible that perhaps the forbidden fruit was really like psychedelic mushrooms yeah that's a very
prominent theory of course the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil which actually creates consciousness
self consciousness as Genesis points out and they knew that they were naked in
other words they knew that previously they had not been clothed with the construct which our rational thought
which our self consciousness and so forth and so on so that many people
including Gordon Wasson wasfo and very important thinker for everything I'm saying here especially on the
psychedelic theory I think it was he who first proposed that the Apple was in
fact a magic mushroom and that theory was taken up by John Allegro in his book
the mushroom in the cross which has been completely trashed by everybody is and is totally insane but I happen to think
it's a really great book in which he traces the mushroom lore amongst the Semitic Semitic peoples ending up with
the Bible and identifies Jesus as a mushroom in the end
I can't even hear your tone you don't have to how do you think the Sufi myth
of the birds relates to all of this in what sense to the generation of culture and
consciousness and people's and the way they're living or do you see that I'm
sorry I I haven't thought about it and nothing springs to mind I'll talk I'll
think about it and get back to you you know some of the stuff you were saying about the myth of the primitive people
not being able to see photographs a lot of that has to do with you know Robert
Flaherty's quote-unquote in Anoka the north's an ability to see motion pictures and it had nothing to do with
this intellect it had to do with like his weight he did hadn't learned how to see that kind of light and his eyes were
adjusted to a different kind of color spectrum you know living in the white north you know quote-unquote
yeah yeah obviously there are always reasons for a failure for the failure of perception what's what's interesting to
me is that these failures are universal and they cannot be imputed to primitive peoples in fact as I said I believe that
the sensorium of prehistoric humanity was much much larger than that of at
least early agriculture and even with all the explosion of information and endless endless information that we that
we think of as a great complexity it may still be far simpler and more
impoverished than the censorial world of say the Neanderthals and so all the only
point that I was trying to make is not I wasn't trying to explain how these failures of perception occur
that's an interesting study in perceptual brain processes what I was interested in was if to make an
arbitrary separation between brain and mind and point out that the mind of modern Europe is also thoroughly riddled
with such failures of perception Oliver Sacks just wrote a big gigantic essay about these people whose sight was
restored at 50 years old for the first time in their life and their complete inability to process information
and the way that people that have learned to see camped the whole development of the third dimension in
art only occurs in the Renaissance and is in fact completely artificial and it
relates to our natural our natural perceptions in only the most tangential
ways but since the since the Renaissance we've been trained to see in three dimensions and we've been trained to
think that art which does not include these three dimensions is primitive art and there are still art historians who
will tell you that Islamic art never developed the third dimension and therefore it's just merely decorative
art or the the the painters of the cave painters of the Paleolithic never
developed the third dimension as if the perception of the third dimension was some proof of evolutionary superiority
it is it's just a different way of doing art that's all"

       <strong>Uncut Dialogue with Peter Lamborn Wilson (Hakim Bey) by George Quasha</strong>
    </a> - This uncut dialogue with poet, writer, and anarchist philosopher Peter Lamborn Wilson (aka Hakim Bey) was conducted by George Quasha for *POETRY IS Vol. II* (2015). The edited version is available at <a href="http://www.art-is-international.org" target="_blank" class="styled-link">art-is-international.org</a>. 

        <em>POETRY IS</em> is part of the larger project <em>ART IS / POETRY IS / MUSIC IS</em>, which began in 2002 and involved filming over 1000 artists, poets, and musicians across eleven countries. This video was released in October 2022 for the Brooklyn Rail memorial for Peter Lamborn Wilson (October 20, 1945 – May 22, 2022).
    
    The full dialogue is a profound exploration of the nature of poetry, its intersections with action, magic, and philosophy, and its broader implications for art, language, and society. Below are the key insights from this rare and detailed interview:<br><br>
    
    
            <strong>Poetry as Action and Enactment:</strong> Wilson compares poetry to "showing" rather than "telling," emphasizing its performative and experiential dimensions. His concept of “vanishing art” integrates poetry with site-specific works that intertwine landscape, history, and communal engagement, making poetry a lived experience rather than a static text.<br><br>
						
            <strong>Magic and Language: Alignment Over Ritual:</strong> Drawing on figures like Cornelius Agrippa and Marsilio Ficino, Wilson sees magic as the synchronization of speaking, writing, and doing. His focus is on natural magic, where creativity harmonizes with the broader forces of the world, rather than on ceremonial or ritualistic practices.<br><br>
						
            <strong>The Romantic Dilemma: Failure as a Form of Resistance:</strong> Wilson critiques poetry’s diminished societal role in modernity but frames this "failure" as a form of resistance against commodification, preserving poetry’s authenticity and transformative potential.<br><br>
						
            <strong>Anarchism and the Poetics of Language:</strong> Wilson embeds anarchist principles of freedom and decentralization into the fabric of his poetic practice, aiming to create a "possible reader" who might internalize these principles and embody a new way of being.<br><br>
						
            <strong>Intersections of Tradition and Experimentation:</strong> Combining influences from Sufi mysticism, Romantic poetics, and modernist experimentation, Wilson constructs a hybrid approach to poetry that balances historical tradition with innovative expression.<br><br>
						
            <strong>Temporal and Communal Power of Poetry:</strong> Wilson emphasizes poetry’s subtle, long-term impact on individuals and communities, fostering shifts in thought and perception that ripple through time.<br><br>
						
            <strong>Postmodern Bardic Role:</strong> While acknowledging the dissolution of traditional bardic roles, Wilson reimagines the poet as a subtle influencer who inspires change through moments of connection and meaning.<br><br>
						
            <strong>Humor, Transformation, and the Magic of Language:</strong> Wilson’s engagement with language reflects a blend of humor, alchemy, and mysticism, underscoring his belief in poetry’s transformative potential and its ability to reveal hidden truths.<br><br>
						
            <strong>The Poet as Seed-Planter:</strong> Rejecting grandiose claims, Wilson sees the poet’s role as planting seeds of transformation, inspiring gradual shifts within individuals and communities over time.<br><br>
    
    This dialogue captures Wilson’s commitment to re-enchanting the world through poetry, integrating action, magic, and anarchist philosophy. His reflections challenge us to see poetry as a living, evolving practice—a form of resistance and re-enchantment that holds the potential to transform art, society, and imagination.

            "well I thought that you would ask me
that and so I thought about it a little
bit and I came up with the idea that
among many other things I could say
poetry is more like action than prose
it's like in elementary school when you
used to do show and tell
it seems to me that um
that uh that that prose is like telling
what poetry is like showing so it's more
like action but it still isn't itself
completely action it's still writing and
therefore it still must be
representation
but
and therefore for that reason I've
pushed what I do farther towards
the poll of activity or action
uh leaving behind simply the simple
paper written page I guess and I do
these Vanishing art
installations or routines or works or
whatever you want to call them or I have
been doing them as prolongations of
poetry into a further level of action
and the action in that case being
then it takes on certain elements of art
but it takes on certain elements of
performance certain elements of magic
conceptual art also historical art also
writing remains a great part of it so
most of these pieces are about some
they're mostly they're all of that place
they're all about landscape and they're
all about the history of those places
and Landscapes so they've risen out of
my
Research into local history here in the
in the Hudson Valley mostly so that so
that I can actually bring all of those
elements together it's not that I want
to be a regionalist in any you know I'm
not going to start using New York
dialect if there were such a thing
anyway I'm not even I don't think there
is any more Double Dutch or whatever no
not in that sense but I have to be a
regionalist because I have to be able to
be in the place
while I'm doing the work instead of with
writing where you can get step step back
from it in time and place yeah so to me
it seems a little bit more ungae to use
a term from fencing
and
um I don't know whether it's some I it's
not an ideal
uh and I don't think it's anything
particularly new either I think a lot of
other people have done similar things
but maybe not so many people have come
to it true written word into the art
scene
a lot of people look on this a lot of
people do this kind of thing they look
on it as on the form and they see it
only as art but I see it also as a form
of writing
so that's my position at the moment like
and I can't think of anything uh okay oh
can I but if you can ask questions yes
of course yeah okay
um you mentioned magic
um this is of course the hardest
dimension to talk about in terms of Art
and poetry but it's obviously Central to
your view as it is to mine and
um so my question would be
the experience for you of the poem
whether it would be a poem that you
consider to be in the domain of the of
the magical in some sense or or or your
own work is that
is the is it is it in the experience
because if you say it's an action then
the action would apply to the nature of
the thing in which it speaks right well
I like to I like to point out that what
I'm doing is not ceremonial magic in the
strict sense of the word I mean I use
Cornelius Agrippa and other sources as
inspiration but I could I couldn't do it
as ceremonial magic for one thing then I
would have to tie everything in with
astrology so I'd be doing it only at the
precise right moment and trying to get
everything organized in a place and of
course I don't drive so I need people to
uh assist me in this and I I need people
to assist me in other ways in these
works too they're meant to be social
events private social events is another
way of looking at them
and so I can't tell everybody they have
to be there on the cusp of Neptune when
it's entering into Sagittarius or
whatever you know it's just not going to
work and I can't be sacrificing the
tongue of the Newt and the eye of the
Frog it's just silly right we don't do
that kind of thing but it's a very
strong influence on what I do
and in the sense that what I speak and
what I do want to come closer and closer
together and that's in that sense very
much if that's magic then yes but if it
means a specific kind of mumbo jumbo
then no it's
um it's influenced by that just like
it's influenced by performance art but
it's not a performance I don't perform I
just do the thing that I'm going to do
yeah and I don't make a theatrical big
deal about doing it the way the way
performance artists do right right
um well you're you're focusing very much
on the action aspect of it the art
whatever you would think of that as
whether you should be able to Art and
you think as you said is writing
um and the performative aspect of it in
the sense of performance rather than
performative in the sense that the poem
is the event of which it speaks uh and
then and the event doesn't exist
separate from the the poem I'm I want to
bring it a little bit back towards the
act of writing yourself not not the
action as writing but writing as its own
action and is that a magical process uh
you know that's been a big
disappointment over the over the years
over the centuries of the Romantic uh
movement
um so many people have have tried to
write as if writing could be or is
of course one immediately thinks that
the case book
the textbook cases you know Rambo's
sonnet of the vowels but look what
happened to Rambo you know he gave it up
and discussed and so I've stopped
writing and uh went to Africa to make
money that's one view we don't know why
he did it well uh I think if you read
his last Works
clearly he's renouncing magic he's
saying it didn't work and it was stupid
to think of it it's very dark his his
last his last writing what about your
mom
and they've all went crazy and hanged
himself
well a lot of magicians have too yeah
it's a dangerous a dangerous thing I
mean I I worship the ground that never
all walks on wish I could go to Paris
and follow his every footstep uh even
more than Rambo in a lot of ways uh and
I because he was such a conscious
hermeticist and some of his writing if
anybody's writing ever does approach it
and certainly his does it at points
but it's always a big disappointment
some something's lacking and that's what
drove me to this
further take this further step
but believe me I'm not saying I've found
a solution to the to the problem you
know the Romantic problem or the problem
of Romanticism because that's what we're
talking about we'll have you abandoned
it none of it's not at all no yeah but
the rating the writing what it is for
you is what is the writing for you
because you made a distinction that it's
not a representation only of something
out there like landscape or history when
I said when I made that difference
between pros and poetry which was
probably too facile and simple
difference but I think it has some uh
has some truth to it yeah at least for
me you know I wanted to be a poet then I
came to the realization in the early 80s
that no one was reading poetry anymore
that it was a very it was no longer a
public act that the whole idea of The
Bard was finished
there was a beatnik thing and that was
over
so I took I actually took my poems and
turned them into prose
so that people would read them right and
I I said these are look these are
political manifestos I didn't and I
stopped calling them poems and it kind
of worked people did take much more
notice of them then so then little by
little however I started writing prose
you know and for 20 years I was very
wrapped up with pros and with the
problems of History anthropology
economics
history of religions
etc etc and it's desperate you know kind
of desperate uh 20-year project to
figure out what the hell is going on in
in the world in reality
and that was a very prosaic task if I
can put it that way
and then you know around the middle to
the end of the 90s when I kind of
figured out what was going on
or at least wanted to move on to another
stage it seemed to me that
um I would go back to poetry knowing
full well that it's a failure
uh that it doesn't communicate that it's
not taken seriously
um and uh that I would just have to live
with that I'd have to write out of that
right in that position because if you
try to think seriously of poets as an
unacknowledged legislators
it may have been true once but in the
post-modern period it no longer seems to
be so
um poets don't set the the trends in a
post-modern situation
uh where there's no possibility of an
avant-garde
where where every every every movement
comes back to haunt the world together
you know and no no one movement is ahead
of any other movement and no one no
group of people saying look do it our
way and then that'll be the Revolution
and then everyone can be a poet that is
the Romantic goal ultimately is that
everyone should be an artist right I
think if you could sum up the whole
romantic revolution in one phrase that
would be it
and
modern poetry is not in a position to
make that happen
so the best you can say is that
failure is a kind of success in the
modern world because if something is
successful and almost kind of
um indicates there's something wrong
with it
you know but there's something corrupt
about it it's like a thing of some
editing the things from the Robert Kelly
event in New York and I'm here I'm
listening to parts of it as I do it all
those things about you know third of the
way through and putting them online as I
go
yells opening remark in this what's his
name novel Chaser was his name the
novelist that he refers to right at the
beginning of his talk and he says he
says in in the novel like somebody says
uh what you're doing I'm going to a
poetry reading which one is I'm going to
hear
um what's his name uh you know who was
uh professionally Dante who's the poet
laureate um you know charity yes not
charity but the more recent one uh yeah
you know I'm talking about Raymond
Robert Haas yeah not hot but Rob Roberts
I'm going to hear Robert Penske the guy
says
I'm not going to say anything about that
but uh I mean if if you're going to talk
about the people who have been our pro
at laureates over the past yeah and
success is not what we're looking for no
no exactly exactly but okay not to in
any way disagree with anything that
you've said
um just to point out that you are in a
curious kind of position here because
your heart is in being a communitarian
and the other part of your heart you
have different chambers apparently of
your heart because another part of your
heart is obviously an esoterrist which
by definition cannot be speak to the
World At Large in any direct way
that's why we use the word esoteric and
I suppose that's
there is an authentic Community you two
people in this room are affected by your
work as a magical Act of great power
there's one of the definitions of magic
that not necessarily ritual magic or
ceremonial magic or
um well let's say that magic is supposed
to change the world well how do you know
it's just another reason why I don't
want to make it the claim that I'm
actually doing it no I understand that I
understand that I'm on your side here
but a couple of us might say
um However the fact that the world has
not yet split apart is is because the
magic is working
yes of course and that that's what uh
Native people always say that if they
didn't say these prayers then the sun
wouldn't come up and the world would
stop going uh and that's a nice thought
but we don't think that way
uh we moderns don't think that way we're
post-modern people don't who are you
speaking about when you say that you
don't think that way
no in my heart of hearts I can't say
that I do okay maybe maybe the hyperbole
of making the sun come up is a little
too extreme for us but
there are other aspects of vital
sustenance uh psychic Clarity and
orientation no you're not going to get
me to say that poetry is useless
I wouldn't that's not what I that's not
what I meant what I meant was that it
was powerless
that doesn't make sense to me if you if
you're saying that if we're
acknowledging that it does have a
certain kind of power let me go back to
one thing the distinction about what
magic is I'm very aligned in my mind a
lot of the time with the kind of ideas
of natural magic
um uh fuccini and people like that and
um
the the the the the the the the natural
magic might be expressed as
a recognition that magical operations
are going on because mind is pervasive
with everything and the magician is the
one who knows to see that it kind of has
the Taoist aspect in the lines himself
on this okay that's certainly true
however there is an operative aspect of
magic especially when you start reading
people like Cornelius Agrippa right of
course uh and for that matter ficino who
talks in his uh in his planetary uh
rituals are meant for healing so they
are meant to change the world yeah
they're meant to change at least one
body and that would be the first of all
the body of the of the practitioner but
I think for Chino also was slyly
proposing at least a small community of
people to be involved in this new
religion he was from that he was
inventing or Reinventing
so um
of course you know there's the I there
there's a magic you do absolutely alone
and which is like that natural magic
which is being part of the part of the
Dow in some way but then there's this
operative idea it's a magic where it's
going to change the world in some
Mark you know in the way that Marx meant
when he said philosophy hasn't changed
the world
yes it doesn't attend the Hollywood eyes
the expectation of the effect that we're
going to have uh uh
what can I say I'm an unreconstructed
person of the generation of 68.
I haven't I haven't given up those ideas
I haven't given them up yeah but we
don't have to be attached to a
particular image of how that would come
about that's my point
no but we did if uh if we want what we
do to be working on that level that's
something entirely different yeah well
of course
that's the bardic level
that is the bardic level right the way
not only the ancient Celtic bards saw it
but also the Ginsburg
the more effective bargs in our in our
historical memory like Whitman didn't
read Agrippa as far as we know
um I mean he didn't read he wasn't he
wasn't an esoterrist he wasn't he was
something else he was something he
perhaps invented by being who he was I'm
not so sure didn't he uh wasn't he in
touch with that guy Buckland who wrote
the thing about the cosmos or perhaps
but it doesn't mean I don't mean you
didn't have sympathies in that direction
I mean that his actual energy the way it
it worked we like Ginsburg
look at it I mean he he was a blanking
him totally totally involved in Magic
yeah black I agree totally I totally
agree but he he accepted a role that was
that had a certain modesty and one of
the beautiful things about Ginsburg was
his actual modesty his willingness to
put himself on the line well naturally
of course he thought it was funny also
to be a part of the modern world he sure
did putting his queer shoulders
absolutely I thought that was amusing
amusing even ironic
but that didn't didn't stop him and his
whole and that and that whole generation
which uh had so much influence on me
from thinking that there must be a
connection between poetry and the
changing of the world yeah that 68 was
meant to have been and of course wasn't
well Ginsburg was as far as I'm
concerned in Rocky a Flats
protest I mean they I I actually think
they've saved the world from destruction
I think that if that plutonium had not
been stopped at that point that there's
no minimal dose of of plutonium any of
it in the atmosphere is deadly I mean he
they've saved a lot but they actually
were very effective and there are a
certain number of instances and you
might be seeing one right now with the
Wall Street uh
occupation protest why is that being run
by Poets I hadn't heard no but it's got
some of this there's some there are
there yeah I don't even mean by Poets
but I just mean the possibility for the
generation of people who would listen to
a Ginsburg are running that
um and it's incredible to me that to see
that Awakening in that way it's enough
yes it could happen but it hasn't uh in
my view it hasn't
um it hasn't happened yet
we're going to agree on that but I I
want to say that I'm really interested
in what happens inside Lane your poetry
is powerful for me I mean it's obviously
I feel a kinship with it with great
knowledge when I give you some of
Poetics to read that there is some kind
of root sympathy there and it's not at
the level necessarily of of that we're
talk we've just been talking about but
at some other level and I feel in in
those poems something that is has got a
humorous quality it's in in the serious
laughter of sense of of alchemy it's got
a um
um an unexpectedness of a transformative
and something there's something in the
process of the language which is magical
to my mind that's one of you experience
that yourself or you've attached it gosh
you know how am I supposed to say no
yeah
it's like when this is a great Tibetan
teacher was talking at Yale uh and uh
somebody a very funny guy too he's very
smart somebody asked him he said he says
we're here in New Haven and the the the
the scriptures say that every place is a
little hitesh for a manifestation you
feel that way about about New Haven he
says okay they say no
one would be tempted New Haven if
anywhere
uh no obviously not and uh I can't I
can't deny that the that that aspect is
always uh Forefront in what in my mind
in what I do tell me what you how you
see that aspect but that is for you
I mean my complete development as a as a
writer owes for example as much to
Persian Sufism as it does to the Western
poetic tradition already when I was a
teenager I was already involved in
reading a Sufi literature poems in
Translation and rewriting them in order
to make them sound better in English so
that I could read them with pleasure
and I've been doing stuff like that all
my life and I lived in lived in in Iran
for seven years I lived in India for
three years
so there's that whole side of things of
my work and I've been a historian of
religions and I'm a historian of the
religions of those countries where I
lived
as well as others
so
um I write out of and that's in that
sense I'm
writing I have not just not a tradition
but uh maybe many traditions
um including modern poetry which of
course I was also brought up on
um
so all of that is absolutely Inseparable
from the themes of magic and mysticism
all the way from you know from Sufism to
um
to the all the fantasy uh poets and
artists that I liked so much when I was
12 or 13 years old
and which you know the Art Nouveau and
the the
fantasy Echo period which had so so much
influence on on hippie aesthetic
that's that's because we were all
looking at um
Dover reprints of Aubry beersley stuff
when we were you know in elementary
school or at least I was and
I think a lot of other people were too
to judge by what happened to Art in the
60s
so which was entirely to do with magic
and and even specifically to do with
evoking that late 19th early 20th
century fascination with her medicism
that was still producing
you know I've just been reading a
biography of Alfred Gary exactly
and he was completely wrapped up in all
that not that the biographer is very
sensitive to it because most modern
Scholars are not right but I could see
reading between the lines what what
Japanese must have been reading in terms
of her medicism and uh and the European
magical tradition
it's very very important for that entire
aesthetic World absolutely and and Ergo
yeah and then Duchamp although it's only
recently that people talk about Duchamp
as a hermeticist because his connection
with Shari is is also part of it though
in that very sense yeah absolutely and
those people in turn were you know came
out of the world of of De nirval and
baudelaire and Rambo and Charles Fourier
the the
utopian socialist philosopher who was
very important for all of them in
resurrecting hermeticism in in French
poetry
but there's the other connection like in
the language itself like there's this
mother may okay and he was another one
another one yeah
symbolists I call them oh that's
interesting yeah well mother may would
be mine probably my other than Blake my
deepest model of something that keeps
calling me to The View that magic
happens in the intricacies of language
itself now that was his belief yeah and
I of course I love him and
[Music]
I always think when I hear about it was
it Tuesday afternoons that you know
Tuesday evenings that he used to get
together yeah
I I always think of myself being there I
people study photographs of of him and
his in his in his rooms and um a little
leave for that book the book yeah and he
of course little known fact he himself
was a lifelong
Anarchist activist he subscribed to all
the anarchist magazines he supported all
the causes he gave to you know
signed all the petitions he wasn't a
fighter he was a poet but his beliefs
were completely anarchistic
as I think were Jerry and and all all
those people
yeah and it also it puts it it it it
actually adds something to the theory or
in practice of anarchistic uh mind an
existing way of being orientation when
you consider that fact that they are
because there's a way in which I mean
you could say
yeah it's inside language itself the
principles of anarchism are inside the
Poetics somehow that's what I want to
find that's what I want to hear
something I mean I I know that you
practice it and I just want to hear if
you think that you practice it
when you think about it I mean I read
you that way let me let's let's just put
it this way yeah
um I wish I I wish I had a big overblown
ego and I could just say yeah that's
what I do but instead since I like to be
modest I will say that's what I wish
that I could be seeing myself as doing
well how about this idea
if the poet is the only the sense in
which the poet is the unacknowledged
legislator of the world might be that
the poet creates the possible reader
that is to say the I don't see your
poems for the ecologues would be my
current best model in your work is this
um as as drawing the Mind into it's a
possible way with language a possible
way of action in the sense that you mean
it precisely but but happening in at the
level of language so that its effect is
on the mind of the person and you
couldn't you wouldn't be able to tell
maybe for a generation
what whether that to exceed I mean just
in terms of how long it takes for people
to sometimes process radically new
things well you know I'll just say again
that was finishing that book then that's
what impelled me to go into this next
step uh because
um although I'm
probably more satisfied with that book
than any of any of my other books it
still wasn't
but I had to I had to to push out into
this slightly more ceremonial slightly
more of the uh performative slightly
more artistic uh physical object related
uh action related right well you've just
made me realize something that one of
the senses in which poetic action
actually does influence history which is
anything that happens from it in the
world and maybe a minute little bit of
history but it's history and who knows
where what the seed will produce because
everything starts small and gets big
right
um
the way that that you just said that
making those poems then kind of spills
forward into action is it is the very
proof of the Poetics that you've been
talking about
for you you did it I mean okay inshallah
God willing well yeah they must be
willing I wouldn't be happy with it
because if that's what you can that's
what I can't say
it would be a jinx if I said that uh-huh
okay well
um I I I I'm I don't know if we're there
at all but I I think we've run out of
time anyway well possibly yeah we're at
30 minutes and 14 seconds so oh okay
but was that is that satisfying news
that did listen
these things are usually not more than a
few minutes are they well I I that's not
following me after I'm going to do
longer versions by the way of
individuals about poetry is Flash well
sometimes when we have an open end so
that we're not looking I don't like to
do a part two sure we could because
actually I have to say that I'm
exploiting this occasion with you
because these are questions I wanted to
talk to you about in some sort of
intensely focused way that kind of puts
you on the spot so that you have to kind
of come up with something even though
you may be reluctant to it you know
because they're difficult questions
these are hard questions but I because
of my passionate interest in your work I
want to well let's cut this one with you
at inshallah okay and I'd be happy to do
another one with you sometime"

       <strong>Peter Lamborn Wilson on Hermeticism and Spiritual Anarchism</strong>
    </a> - In this lecture, Peter Lamborn Wilson (pen name "Hakim Bey") continues his series on Hermeticism, focusing on the trends of spiritual anarchism in 19th-century United States. Wilson explores the intersection of mysticism, radical politics, and cultural movements, offering a unique perspective on the philosophical undercurrents of the time.

    <br>
		
		<strong>Context: Spiritual Anarchism and Hermeticism</strong>
<p>&bull; <em>Wilson builds on his previous lectures about Hermeticism</em>, a tradition of mystical, philosophical, and alchemical thought, which influenced American history from the colonial period onward.</p>
<p>&bull; He traces how Hermetic ideas—emphasizing hidden wisdom, esotericism, and a spiritual quest—reemerge in the 19th century through radical religious and social movements.</p>
<p>&bull; He situates the rise of spiritual anarchism within broader historical and social trends, particularly post-Revolutionary America, where capitalism, industrialism, and national identity clashed with liberatory spiritual movements.</p>

<strong>19th Century as a Transformational Period</strong>
<p>&bull; <em>Industrial and Capitalist Expansion:</em></p>
<p>&bull; America transitioned from an agrarian society to an industrial power.</p>
<p>&bull; The romanticized idea of an “endless frontier” began to erode, raising ecological and existential questions about the role of wilderness and nature.</p>
<p>&bull; <em>Radical Spiritual Movements:</em></p>
<p>&bull; Emerged as a response to materialism and political rigidity, particularly in the “Burnt-Over District” of New York.</p>

<strong>Key Radical Movements and Figures</strong>
<p>&bull; <strong>Perfectionism:</strong> <br> &bull; Belief in achieving sinless perfection. <br> &bull; Exemplified by the Millerites and John Humphrey Noyes’ Oneida Community.</p>
<p>&bull; <strong>Spiritualism:</strong> <br> &bull; Popularized by the Fox Sisters; emphasized spirit communication. <br> &bull; Tied to feminism through women’s roles as mediums.</p>
<p>&bull; <strong>Transcendentalism:</strong> <br> &bull; Emerson and Thoreau bridged individualism, nature mysticism, and reform. <br> &bull; Inspired utopian communes like Brook Farm.</p>
<p>&bull; <strong>Fourierism:</strong> <br> &bull; Advocated attractive labor and sexual liberation. <br> &bull; Influenced American communes like the Wisconsin Phalanx.</p>
<p>&bull; <strong>Free Love:</strong> <br> &bull; Critiqued monogamy, advocating for egalitarian relationships. <br> &bull; Figures like Victoria Woodhull challenged Victorian norms.</p>

<strong>Civil War as a Turning Point</strong>
<p>&bull; Reform movements were co-opted by political forces, narrowing abolitionism and suppressing broader critiques of capitalism.</p>
<p>&bull; Feminism shifted focus to suffrage, abandoning critiques of marriage and sexuality.</p>
<p>&bull; Industrialization eroded the connection to wilderness and spiritual frontiers.</p>

<strong>Thematic Connections</strong>
<p>&bull; <em>Nature Mysticism:</em> Public parks like Central Park reflected Fourierist ideas of reconnecting with nature.</p>
<p>&bull; <em>Recurrent Cycles:</em> Radical ideas resurface in movements like the 1960s counterculture.</p>

<strong>Philosophical Implications</strong>
<p>&bull; Wilson critiques the marginalization of 19th-century movements, emphasizing their experimentalism and relevance to modern challenges.</p>

<strong>Key Takeaways</strong>
<p>&bull; <em>Continuity of Radical Thought:</em> Modern movements owe their origins to 19th-century experiments.</p>
<p>&bull; <em>Critique of Centralization:</em> The Civil War suppressed pluralism and spiritual anarchism.</p>
<p>&bull; <em>Enduring Relevance:</em> Spiritual anarchism critiques materialism and authoritarianism.</p>

<strong>Conclusion</strong>
<p>&bull; Peter Lamborn Wilson’s lecture reveals the pivotal role of 19th-century spiritual anarchism in American history. <br> &bull; Through detailed analysis, he highlights the legacy of figures and movements that sought harmony between spiritual and material existence.</p>

            "in order for uh what and
um I publish books with autonom media semi text and what else do I do I don't
know I'm that sort of thing all right and um
last time we talked about uh hermeticism uh the Occult Philosophy of
U of um the helenistic period and of the Renaissance and then I tried to bring
that into the uh into new world history into American history and show that from
the very beginning there were um people in in the new world interested
in occultism and hermeticism and that it plays a deep role in our hidden history and
uh uh today tonight I want to leave uh leave the 17th and 18th century behind
again uh and move on to the 19th century which actually is
uh we're leaving a gap um because I think we probably left off uh the story
in around the time of the American Revolution and now suddenly we have to jump to about 1820 or
1830 and it's a question as to exactly what was happening in between those dates um and it's a question in my
mind in terms of occultism and hermeticism and the spiritual quest in
America it seems like a kind of Dead period for a lot of these subjects uh
this wouldn't wouldn't be unusual there have been other more abund periods uh
the post Civil War era as we'll as we'll hear as I'll I'll try to get to uh in this lecture was certainly one of them
it was a time when uh when America was too involved in um I guess the sort of
economic Adventure the front that that aspect of the frontier from the from the time of the
Revolution uh I think that in many respects the the American Revolution and certainly the
Constitution which the Constitutional movement which came after it was
uh um not particularly good for the subject for the for the trends
that we're discussing um before the re before the Revolution
paradoxically there was the possibility for as you know chairman Mau would have said a thousand flowers to bloom whereas
After the Revolution there was then an American ideology and people were being whipped into shape to uh to conform to
that ideology and the the Constitution I have always seen as a uh completely
reactionary document in that even even what was left of the radical project of
the American Revolution by 1789 the uh ruling class uh the people
who were setting themselves up as the ruling class in the wake of the Revolution the the winners the people
came out on top in that particular uh Topsy Turvy situation used the Constitution
basically to in some ways to put the kbash on the uh uh diversity and and um
and sort of splend wackiness of the period that went before the Revolution when when uh there was a
lot in my opinion a lot more freedom of thought I think if you want to look for for one influence which causes this
inter intervening period to become dull it would probably be the con the Constitution and the kind of political
reaction that went with it and I'll get back to that in the next lecture when I talk about the Dark Side of of
hermeticism in American history because the U uh there was also an occult aspect to
uh to that as well but what we're primarily interested in here is the more radical um
liberatory um even Proto eological movements uh although of course
ecology and the preservation of the Wilderness is something that uh that just simply is is not an idea in the
18th century there was just too much of it and there was to to worry about preserving it there were people who were
already into a kind of nature mysticism as we talked about last time uh but even
that was not as highly developed as what we're going to see in the 19th century by about 1820 or 1830 and the Jacksonian
thing and the whole you know takeoff of big-time American uh this
self-identity um Americans now beginning to think of themselves as the hot noon nation in the world uh emergent
capitalism emergent industrialism etc etc etc
um this uh this very success this very industrial
success uh for the first time began to give people a certain twinge of thought that uh the Wilderness was not Eternal
and that nature was not inviable um and in fact most of the if you if you read the L most the
literature from the period people were in favor of that uh even even some of the most radical thinkers right up to
the end of the 19th century and I include marks in this uh category took no interest whatsoever INE in the
preservation of wilderness what they were interested in was the extension and rationalization of the
industrial system um it's only it was only uh
around about the middle of the 19th century that anyone at all PA began to
think in terms of saving uh some remnant from what had previously been
thought to be just the state of nature I mean we were in this new world there was always a sort of infinite Frontier there
was always more Forest to cut down there were always more Indians to eliminate you know it just went on forever no one
thought of it's having an end but suddenly when you become conscious of the end of something Ah that's when you
begin to think about uh preserving it about in institutionalizing it about in fact worshiping
it so um in the 1820s uh and 30s a curious um
development began to occur in the North Eastern parts of the country which led
to an explosion of interest in uh radical politics and spirit and radical spirituality and many sociologists and
ethnographers and historians and anthropologists and savants of various sorts have uh have given a good deal of
uh puzzlement and heads scratching over why this development took place one theory is that a lot of um people who
had to escape from New England because the soil was was literally being um worn
out and job possibilities were being taken up and and the you know the
factories were being built but not fast enough to provide job so there was this major migration out to Western New York
State uh along the recently opened eie Canal or the canal that was being opened
up into what had been Wilderness and this general area sort of extends as far
as Ohio and it sort of goes back as into New England as far as the burkers which
uh in the 18th century the burkers in that region had been the frontier so that was the old Frontier and Ohio was
the New Frontier let's say more or less L and in between was this vast region of
Upstate New York um and parts of other states parts of Vermont and whatnot
which we now think of is uh totally depressed but uh at the time was was was
a hot new U hot new area actually much more heavily populated than they now
oddly enough and these people being new englanders had mostly I get you know
this is this is my hypothesis having been new englanders they had and
mostly oh lower than middle class down to down to working class um had been in a inferior position
Visa the old New England Gentry and the Puritan um authorities and when they got
physically geographically out from under those those uh those forces somehow they
were able to Blossom and the Heritage the hidden Heritage of radical
protestantism uh began to reemerge uh with uh scintillating and exciting results and
this area of the country uh for some reason which I really have no explanation of whatsoever centers around
Rochester New York and uh yeah a pretty unlikely place for it one would think um
I've I've I've never been to Rochester and I greatly look forward to going up there and trying to uh trace the remains
of what one historian called The Burnt Over District H by which he meant that
one wave of enthusiasm after another swept over this area with Rochester as
the hot epicenter and U it's excellent book I've the name of the author has escaped me
and I've just today come back from Dublin and I hadn't didn't have a chance to go home and look a few things up so
you have to Pardon a few gaps in my memory tonight there's anything anything that I can't give you in the way of a
date or a name that annoys you uh let me make a note of it and I'll try to rectify it next time um so uh the first
the first wave the first prairie fire or whatever you want to call it that swept over this District was
um revivalism holy you know uh what we would now think of is Holy Roller kind
of Tent Revival revivalism which had uh been a factor in the New England
revivals uh in the earlier earlier uh or let's say in the late 18th and early 19th century but now took on a new and
somewhat hysterical tinge I mean there are um there are accounts of the revivals from this period of uh uh for
the really for the first time in American history I think it's kind of Holy Roller type of phenomena appearing
the frothing at the mouth the kind of pseudo epilepsy the um the the extreme
ecstatic feelings of uh uh you know far more far more dramatic IC than anything
that even Jonathan Edwards could have dreamed of and um this wave of Revival
swept up and down the eastern coast in general but it was very very intense in the burnt over
district and every couple of years there would be some new hero some new popular
uh you know Billy Graham type Billy Sunday Type character of the of the era and and these these people whom we have
around us now Billy Graham for example is a direct heir of this one particular
uh development in American religious history but he is as it were just stuck stuck in that period I mean there hasn't
been any development in that thinking since the 1830s it's still the basically
this the same theology the same kind of watered down puritanism with a with a
message a more optimistic message about salvation added on to it and but at the
time in the 1820s that little optimistic message about salvation was exceedingly radical so puritanism as we know
basically Calvinism uh uh stuck in the idea of of um of uh fate you know um um
predetermination uh as opposed to free will uh everyone is um sort of assumed
to be damned until proven otherwise by being a good Puritan uh there's there's a real Gloom
to calvinist puritanism and a real uh you know was as Nathaniel Hawthorne
noted in his story about uh Morton of marry Mount that there was this uh uh
and in a lot of his other writings about that period I think captured that that um that uh sour Gloom of the Puritans so
just as the these people farmers and U and Artisans mostly
had escaped that the the Theology of Gloom or the gloomy Theology of New
England or or rather had escaped the economic oppression they had also escaped the theological oppression and
um I suppose what you might call arminianism uh the the idea that U man
does have free will that God does love humanity and want to save it and that
it's enough to repent of one's sins to be saved I mean these are all ideas which now sound corny to us we hear them
coming out of very some cable station or another in an attempt to raise money you know and it also sounds exceedingly
reactionary but you should be very clear on this point just as I told you the Baptists at one point were the thin edge
of the wedge of protestant radicalism these were mostly Baptists who were still doing this there were some Quakers
involved and other smaller Protestant sects but um this idea of of of Free
Will and um salvation free salvation I think is the key to
everything that happened subsequently this new a new theology which had always been in inherent in radical
protestantism and in the antinomian sects and so forth that we talked about last time but had had been submerged and
was now going to reemerge in bright and interesting new colors and uh for for example um an
extreme version of this theology was called perfectionism and it stated and this
this began to develop right away in in in out of these Rev movements if if God loves us and it's
enough to repent to be saved well then it's all the next logical step is that
um it is possible to become perfect even in this human life to be completely at
one with with with the Divine principle um to to be able to act in a perfect way
uh or at least to be freed from the burden of sin and to move onward to a real perfectionism this was tied up with
a kind of millenarian feeling of the uh on the more literal level with a
feeling of some sort of perhaps approaching end of the world um and the establishment of uh of
U the reign of the Messiah so for example one of the groups that that uh
that uh swept over the burnt over District was the millerites uh who um were the ancestors
of of the seventh day Adventists and who predicted the end of the world for some somewhere in the early 40s I
1840s I think and then of course it didn't happen uh they were they were
hundreds of thousands of them apparently up on mountain tops all over the Northeast on the on the appointed night
and then you know then they fudged that one and then there was another appointed night a year later or something finally
it was clear that the world was not coming to an end in that sense but um the millerites then transmuted into a uh
what we know them what we know them today and the more radical elements of that sect then went on to something more
more new and exciting uh so perfectionism could take
all kinds of forms all the way from extremely intellectual High futin uh kind of transcendentalist version of it
Emerson was really in a lot of ways a perfectionist in his theology for
example but it could also go to The Other Extreme of this kind of millerite uh uh frenzy or rev ralist frenzy and it
had a whole Spectrum in between it and out of that Spectrum arose a whole
fascinating conjures or family of Reform move reformed sects and movements uh the
word they used was reform which again has been watered down for us doesn't sound so exciting but uh for them in the
19th century it meant something much much more hot the word had connotations it would be much more like what we would
uh use the word radical uh radicalism or or even Revolution or
even revolutionary thought uh reform they were literally thinking about
reforming shaping reshaping the whole of society all of these reform
movements uh in retrospect look as if they dealt with single issues but in the
eyes of the people who were involved in them they were not mostly they were not single-issue things yes there was a you
know an anti-liquor movement and there were people who obsessed out on on that and never did anything but do Temperance
lectures and sort of Proto AA type of societies that was also part of it and
yes there were people who were so obsessed with the evil of slavery that they could only think of abolitionism
and they put everything else uh behind that but gener generally speaking most people embraced a wide range of Reform
ideas so even a totally obsessive type like Garrison the famous
abolitionist uh who is is Remembered in most most histories as precisely just
that as the radical wing of abolitionism was in fact interested in a much wider range of of the so-called reform
movements in the century he was uh he was interested in anarchism and free love and uh uh labor reform and uh um
perfectionism there another perfectionist Theologian Garrison so uh the U what we generally
get from the post Civil War point of view is people looking back and talking about certain aspects which seem to them
to have succeeded so abolitionism seems to have succeeded the civil war came along and the slaves were freed so that
looks like a success so someone like a Garrison is remembered but his Garrison is then squashed down into a very
one-dimensional kind of figure compared to what the real Garrison was really like a very uh uh in intense uh
brilliant rather humorless actually a lot of these guys lacked a sense of humor I I don't know why that is but uh
there was not very many of them were very funny this was a very sincere and
Earnest period of American history as you can easily understand by reading any transcendentalist literature which uh um
with the possible exception of a few Cracks by thorough is you know uh really one of the
most serous of all schools of American literature but it was it was serious and
a kind of uplifting way it was no longer the gloomy seriousness of of the Puritans it was uh optimistic
seriousness there was everything by comparison with the post Civil War era
everything looked very un unsettled I mean undecided in American society and
there really really I don't think it was sheer naive to believe that uh uh an
ideology or a theology could uh transform American society American
society still had a sense of itself as full of potential full of possibility uh possessing many possible
directions that it could go off in and uh on on the vulgar level this was expressed in what we you know what's
called Jacksonian Democracy the U Cult of the common common man and woman um
with all its populist and even racist overtones um and on the higher on the on
the highest intellectual level it was to be expressed in figures like Emerson and
then once again there was the big Spectrum in between so uh what we're what we're
particularly I want to you know I could talk about the totality of the reform movement uh for a whole series of
lectures it's got so many different fascinating aspects but what I want to do is um is is is keep the focus as much
as possible on the spirituality of Reform um first of all you're going to
you're going to ask me is there a continuity between the hermeticist of the 1690s and early 1700s that we talked
about and the spirituality of the mid 19th century and that's a uh that's a
difficult question I think the continuity is is more in terms of images and myths than in actual transmission of
doctrines so once again we have uh what would look to a historian like a a
spontaneous recrudescence of certain ideas or images which in my opinion were
lurking beneath the surface always right from the start in American history and are always there still there American
culture American Spirit whatever you want to call it which are still there and always ready to be dipped back into
so um when you by the end of the transcendentalist movement when you have a Hawthorne um looking back on early
Puritan history and meditating on it you'll see that that the intellectuals who were somewhat aware of History were
in fact picking up on those hermetic and occultist strains in American history
and were weaving them along with the little that they had learned so far of Oriental philosophy and of uh European
medieval mysticism again the earts and the buas were becoming uh meister eart
and yaku buma were becoming popular again um every it seems almost as if
every other generation or sometimes even every generation has to ReDiscover all
this so you get uh places like the open Center where you can come and be told ooh ooh ooh We've Just rediscovered
hermeticism you know and in effect maybe maybe that's so uh because there's a a
weird kind of um uh uh forgetting and remembering line
that goes through uh goes through human history and now now in the 1830s uh
we're in a time of of of remembering and rediscovering that Heritage and making it new in Ezra pound's uh famous phrase
um it's not just going to be a a a retreading of of uh of the uh Colonial
uh hermeticist with their telescopes Up on the Roof U studying the stars for
signs of the coming end or for the wisdom of the ages or the obsession with hieroglyphics
or with the Corpus hermeticum a lot of those things will be not so a lot of those references will not be so easy to
find now but it is definitely as as I said this begins with a Revival
Christian Revival but there are many other things that will be revived as well and there will be
new elements uh being added in for example one very important figure and
one whom I think a lot of you would find very interesting is Emanuel swedenborg the uh Scandinavian occult
philosopher actually began as a scientist sometime in the 18th century again uh sorry for the vagueness
of B dates uh but you can look him up in the encyclopedia branica I me he's a famous well-known how many people have
heard of swedenborg before oh right okay well I don't have to babble on too much about him uh there's a swedenborgian
society to this day there's a church that was founded by his followers called the new church has uh branches in New
York as far as I know it's easy to find swedenborg's writing and um basically
it's a he was a kind of Rudolph Steiner Steiner like uh visionary who had uh
immense um out ding Dante kind of visionary Journeys into the Angelic and
I presumed demonic worlds um he talked to Angels uh uh you know on a daily
basis and um was in fact quite educated and poetic uh uh thinker and his books
uh although you know a lot of modern readers may find them terribly long and and
turgid um at the time time were were were considered to be really exciting he
he was a sort of Carlos castina of his day I guess uh controversial claimed to
be a scientist in fact had been a scientist uh and now you know
discovering amazing Visionary new truths and these his books were immediately translated out of Swedish did he write
originally in Swedish I'm not sure anyway whatever he into every European language including English and were
available early on and very influential for a lot of these American uh uh uh
reformists reformers and lent a kind of angelic or spiritual um occult hermetic
tone to a great a great deal of of these uh of these movements the swed
swedenborgianism was often lurking in the background even even in some of the more rash seemingly
rational uh movements the transcendentalists again who who read
you know who read everything were certainly very much into swedenborg and uh then finally in the
later 19th century you get get all the way up to wonder wonderful figures like uh U Andrew Jackson Davis the sear of
pipy as he was known who uh I think the only only famous Mystic from pyy until
Timothy liry settled there in the um who combined swedenborg with Communism and
started Comm where uh where in theory they were all to be chased on the material Level but
to have Visionary uh spouses from Fairyland uh a really truly delightful
eccentric this guy who uh uh was chased out of New York State finally for uh
allegations of sexual uh carryings on I mean apparently not all of his wives
were purely in the spiritual plane uh and ended up in California he was one of
the first nutcases is to go to California and start a uh a commune there which lasted until right the end
of the century and was one of the pioneers of growing varietal grapes in California so you see it's not all
bad um some of the other movements that swept through
rodchester why rodchester I just don't know um one of the most interesting one
of the most thoroughly written about was spiritualism capital S spiritualism uh in other words um you
know table table turning table wrapping getting in touch with the souls of the dead and this happened again it was
about 1841 when two uh Farmers daughters the fox sisters who lived in a a small
village right outside Rochester began hearing Ghostly rappings and uh uh ascertained that
there were Communications from the a soldier who had been murdered and buried in their cellar in the Revolutionary War
who began uh telling them all kinds of interesting things about the world of the spirits now the fox sisters were
later later on revealed to be complete frauds they apparently had tricked toes
and they could make these sort of sepulcral sounding wraps by clicking their toes under the table so was a
really very crude trick compared to some of the amazingly complex uh uh to horse that that
later spiritualists uh develop veled uh and which eventually Led Led people like
Houdini the famous stage magician to uh lifelong I mean he was the Martin Garder
of his period um to lifelong uh Crusades against all spiritualist as all being
completely phony well that that attitude took a long time to develop and as a matter of fact it really still hasn't uh
uh U triumphed there are great many people who still practice this brand of 19 19th century spiritualism at least in
London I'm not so sure about New York I used to live right down the street from the spiritualist church where uh where
people still go and and communicate with the souls of the Dead in these in these Charming 19th century uh Style seances
with the tables and the you know trumpets appearing in midair and sort of fluffy things floating as what do they
call it um ectoplasm so e ectoplasmic BLS coming out of the bodies of the
medium and uh the society for psychical research still thrives in London and I
think there's an American branch of that they take the whole thing extremely seriously uh at best with a kind of
Charles fortian agnosticism at worst with total gullibility but um in investigating
these these apports as they were called or these Spirit phenomena and um from the time of the
fox sisters on Ward this thing this this movement swept uh out of America
directly over into England and from there I presume you know all around the world and finally ended up for example
coming all the way back again through France uh through a writer who's very little known here Alan Card de into
South America and to this day they tell me that that countries like um uh Brazil
and Argentina are just full of Disciples of Alan cardak who uh combine 19th century
spiritualism with various other occult and African Trends to produce the candomblé and these kind of uh ecstatic
religions of South America so spiritualism is something which has had a completely worldwide influence it's
very important movement in human history and is almost never treated as such because I frankly it is kind of funny
you know um but uh the the number of smart people including for example
Arthur Conan Doyle you know who's usually thought of as the progenitor of sheer rationality in English literature
through his creation of Sherlock Holmes or Edgar Allen Poe who created the
detective tradition in America were also both of them completely obsessed with spiritualism and took it very very
seriously and thought it was literally true one extremely interesting aspect of
spiritualism which has only recently begun to be studied is the relationship with feminism now um there are those who
would say that feminism as we understand it is an offshoot of the spiritualist movement which is I'm pretty sure unless
you've been reading this literature yourselves an idea that you won't have come across I'd certainly shocked me um
the it goes like this the mediums tended to be women and this was really the first way
in in American society that women had some kind kind of a position of power they weren't allowed to preach in
churches for the most part it was very rare to hear a woman speak in church generally only the Quakers would have
allowed it and even they wouldn't have gone in for it in a big way and the some
of the first uh uh women of of generally with no
education because where were they going to get an education other than to give it to themselves through
Reading who and generally of uh of lower middle class to lower class social
Origins who would suddenly take to the uh to The Talk The Talk circuit you know
the sort of Proto chalko or open Center type of circuit of the day uh and would
go around and and do lectures but they would become possessed by great spirits of the past like there was one who
regularly did Aristotle for example and so she would she would become Aristotle and then you could question Aristotle
you know you could ask Aristotle whatever you wanted and but but first she first she would give a
a speech and apparently some of these speeches were were were pretty good they were certainly good entertainment they
that goes without saying because this was a very very successful movement later on in the movement as the table
turning and the ectoplasm and the floating trumpets and whatnot began to get really more and more popular and
that was even more entertaining clearly so you know uh people who were channeling Aristotle sort of went out of
fashion uh and and uh instead were replaced by people like the famous
English medium uh uh home spelled hu M uh who who um did totally amazing
things which still to this day even the stage magicians can't re reproduce some of the things that that he is that he
did or is alleged to have done such as you know there were some extremely sober people who claimed to have seen him uh
levitate himself out a window and and and back in again through another window and things like that so who knows what
he was doing who knows what any of them were doing but one thing that was quite clear
from the sociological point of view was that the spiritualist movement gave women a platform for the first time to
speak from and to and and to have uh and the freedom to have ideas and to be um
at first by channeling these spirits who are usually men uh male spirits but uh
it was nevertheless it was a woman up on the speakers platform people paying you know good 25 cents or more to hear hear
these uh lectures which was pretty fair money in those days and out of that
ferment and out of the excitement of a lot of women who the the typical story
as I read it there's a wonderful book called radical Spirits by Anne brow b r a u
d uh about this subject which I've most of my info is coming from right now um
most of these women would come from extremely unhappy marriages uh maybe with an abusive
spouse uh alcoholic husband whatever you know sad stories and they would escape
from their family sometimes even leaving children behind doing very very upto-date you know 90s 1990s type of
thing uh in in in those in in in that in the term that we understand it now you
know it's it's uh perhaps remarkable for some of us to learn uh that actions that we now
consider to be the ultimate in radical feminism were being carried out already in the 1840s uh 30s and 40s by
spiritualist women and out of that ferment uh to a very large extent
appeared a woman's rights movement or what we would Now call a feminist movement I don't want to say that
feminism had all of the played the the the whole role here but tonight we're looking at spiritual aspects of 19th
century radical reform and this is certainly one of them um to Jump Ahead a
little in the story Victoria Wood hole who was the first woman to run for president in America uh before it was
legal for a woman to run for president so it was really a kind of U um symbolic
act but uh caused a great deal of Stir It was in the immediate more or less immediate post Civil War era I think
that she did that anybody know the date when Victor Iran for president is it 1880 something or it wasn't it was
postwar yeah um she had previously before the Civil War what had she been
up to she had risen to the position of president of the American spiritualist
Association and had presided over some of the most exciting and controversial uh councils of the
American spiritual spiritualist movement she'd also been involved in many many many other reform and in fact in the
entire she was one of those great people who embraced every single Reform movement that was going and we'll get
back to her later she's very interesting figure um I can't spend too much time on any
one of these uh uh there's so many of them I should talk about abolitionism to
a little extent at least if of course it was uh uh if you remember my uh lecture
on radical um spir radical spiritual sect in colonial America there were some
of them were the first people in America or actually the first people in the world to propose the abolition of
slavery and uh so abolitionism is one of America's first and oldest radical
movements but it really once again it really began to get off the ground in in in the 1810s 20s and 30s and of course
reached a u a clima a paroxystic climax uh in in
the 1860s with the Civil War although we mustn't uh we mustn't be allowed to be
ourselves to be duped into believing that the Civil War was about abolition
it wasn't and I'll explain my theories on that a little bit later but uh once
again uh there is absolutely no doubt that most of the abolitionists were far
from being a rationalist uh uh that nobody was an atheist at this time
everyone was a believer of some sort or another and indeed the abolitionists uh
tended to be exceedingly serious uh mystical Christians uh many many of them were
perfectionists and if they weren't perfectionists they were um uh you know
Hellfire and brimstone types of the John Brown variety John Brown was uh was a
very U mystical Christian in a lot of ways and culmination of that of the sort
of um puritanical uh take Onan the Puritans to give them credit where credit is due had always been against
slavery uh and now the radical offshoots of of protestantism that I've been
talking about we going to carry that anti-slavery position uh to much more extreme ends
however once again it's only with hindsight that we see this as the big issue of the middle 19th century for the
people who were involved in it most of the people who were involved in it was only one of a spectrum of issues and in
fact it was said many many many many many times by many many many smart people up until the time of the Civil
War that the slavery of the northern workers Factory workers which was just
beginning to become apparent the rise of you know the Industrial Revolution beginning to hit America in a big way
and that this this degradation was in its own way as disgusting or even more
disgusting in certain ways than the plight of the black slaves of the
South who at least had a kind of social welfare system based on the fact that it
was their bodies that were the valuable you know that the you wanted to preserve a slave for a full working life whereas
Factory workers right right from the beginning it was clear you could just you know chew them up and spit them out
there was an endless supply of them and and wage slavery was seen by all of these people to be just as bad uh I mean
they argued about it Garrison thought that black slavery was the the primary thing to get rid of and that then that
the attack on wage slavery would follow and other people like Lysander Spooner the great uh one of the first great
anarchists in in americ and American uh uh history um went so far as to refuse
to support the North in the Civil War uh because first of all because he believed in the right of anybody's right to
secede from anything uh uh literally anything uh and second because he
thought that um putting um chattle slavery over above all the other forms
of slavery that he perceived slavery of women slavery of the workers uh was uh
was wrong it was intellectually wrong to separate that issue out he believed and therefore he although he certainly
didn't support the Confederacy except in as much as he said they had a right to seced uh he uh didn't support the north
either but he was one of the the daring few at that point not to have caved in
to um to government propaganda on these issues I'll say a bit more about
that um I've already I've already briefly discussed transcendentalism as
the sort of high most high futin intellectual um aspect of this but if
you want to get a if you want to get a slightly ironic but still not inaccurate
picture of what was going on you you could you could you could do worse than read Emerson's essay on New England
reform uh I don't know which one of the of the books it's in it's probably in the portable Emerson and uh he's a
little bit beused and amused by some of the crankier aspects of reformism but nevertheless he was perfectly well aware
that his calls for individualism and and um uh intellectual maturity in the
American cultural mure were part of that movement so um although he um you know
he was a standoffish uh a dry kind of person and he uh he didn't understand
Brook Farm you know he didn't understand the the happiness of of communal uh the
communal aspect the happy communal aspects of transcendentalism perhaps but
he was certainly a major influence on on uh on on many of the minor players in in
transcendentalism and in related reform movements uh uh and in a way more
important for what we're talking about even than thoro whom I personally happen to prefer as a thinker and a writer but
Emerson was more Central to uh to what we're talking about here let me just briefly run through some of the or U
maybe I don't know not so briefly but uh whatever let me get on to some some other of the of the many many movements
that swept through the burnt over District uh Mormonism was one of them Mormonism uh was started not too far
from Rochester When U when Joseph Smith supposedly dug up
the uh uh Golden Plates and the Angelic spectacles that he needed to read the
Golden Plates on which was the Book of Mormon uh and uh this in itself is
interesting because um Smith came out of a movement a very still little studied
movement that was one of the many that swept through the region uh which had to
do with magic treasure finding there was all kinds of people running around the countryside with dowsing rods and
various other strange devices uh finding uh supposedly finding treasure I think a
lot of them were out andout conmen and uh some historians think that Smith was an out andout con man but I'm not going
to get into that um he certainly fit an archetype which has been almost
forgotten of the the country the the country B occultist uh sort of popular figure in
Upstate New York at the time he was only the most successful of them just as you could say the prophet Muhammad was only
the most successful of many competing prophets in Arabia in the 7th Century uh and again um another very
interesting U uh uh and very recently uh only work has been done on
Mason on U masonry as an origin of Mormonism uh uh a lot of the a lot of
the earliest Mormon writings have been found to be extremely closely related to
some of the more obscure uh late 18th and early 19th century uh Masonic uh
tracts and catechisms and uh masonry was not
coincidentally was another one of the movements that swept through the area uh one year you know in one year there were
all these Masonic lodges and then a few years later came the famous anti-as movement well famous I don't know maybe
how many people have heard of anti-masonry there was once as you as you may know there was even an
anti-masonic political party in America that ran a c candidates for go governors
in many of the northeastern states and uh and and for at least in one election
brokered some real power one presidential election uh and this this all blew up because there was there was
a mysterious murder case in the Rochester area again again uh involving
masonry and uh some local journalists and U um conspiracy Buffs uh formed this
anti-masonic movement and got into the all you know uh uh the Masons as a uh
secret Sinister Society who were out to subvert American democracy blah blah blah blah uh really it was the party the
party quickly became a catchall for all kinds of uh uh politically disenfranchised and disappointed uh uh
people who really didn't give a about masonry and uh were just using it as as an excuse as a kind of a rabble
rousing uh thing to talk about and uh in fact the anti-masonic party only lasted
a few years and this whole thing disappear but it did produce some wonderfully amusing literature of uh the you know
Revelations of the evil Masonic doings um and endless endless uh talk
about this murder case the Mas that's the famous Mason Mason murder case uh so
um uh I don't know then and then we have all the the secular movements so-called
the ones which are not specifically religious uh like owenism this was um
named after the great English reformer Robert Owen who uh founded uh one of the
first um industrial par s at new lanarch and his big Mills in in
um Scotland or the north of England or can't remember exactly where anyway he
was he was British and he was he was very very very rich he was an extremely successful industrialist and he poured
his entire Fortune into the um um his his own brand of
socialism they came over to America and bought an entire ready-made commune from
a religious group The Rapides who had decided to move out and go somewhere
else uh and and needed a bank roll so they sold the entire town of Harmony to
uh Owen and he renamed it New Harmony and uh moved all his followers out there
and as some as one historian said did absolutely everything wrong it was possible to do in trying in trying to
start a Utopian community it was a complete mess and um even though o Owen
has a had a lot of interesting he's an interesting thinker in a lot of ways and one of the interesting things
about him is he was one of the first of the of the radical reformers to dare to openly Proclaim himself an atheist which
which of course endeared him to Marx and Engles and so he's remembered as one of the founders of dialectical
materialism uh interestingly enough however despite this militant atheism Owen Ended as a very enthusiastic
spiritualist which just shows you how all these how how all these things floated around and interpenetrated each
other um we get into some of the offshoots of owenism later then there was the French
uh uh philosopher Simon who was one of the one of the uh uh progenitors of
positivism which was later attributed to comp August compt of course but Sanson
was very important in that in that development he was another so-called utopian socialist of of some interest to
Marks and Engles and remembered mostly for that reason but uh uh interestingly
enough U despite his extremely rationalistic communistic and in fact I
would say rationalistic communistic and authoritarian were probably the things that that uh characterized his thinking
but towards the end of his life he got religion and uh but but decided to found
his own religion which was called I believe I believe they called it the Church of humanity which uh make has
interesting resonances back to the um French Revolution when there were temples to reason and uh um you know uh
holidays devoted to rationality and uh U and and and and and sobriety and things
like really it's a very interesting subject some some books have been coming out on it which I haven't been able to
afford yet but uh I definitely want to educate myself on the religion of rationality in in in the French
Revolution because I think it had a lot of influence on many many you know all these hidden hidden strands of influence
and one of them was this emergence of this religion of humanity Simon and Simon died in the 40s at some point and
his chief disciple whose name was anant uh proclaimed himself pope of the
religion of humanity and they designed religious costumes which are extremely amusing to our
eyes you should I wish I should have been able to bring in a picture of Pope
anant in his in his robes it would you get a kick out of it didn't last very
long but you know all of these all these attempts to start off new and perfect or
perfectionistic religions making use of the morality or let's say of the ethics
of Christianity without its without the authority of of the church and and
certainly without predestination and the calvinist Gloom of of the Orthodox Protestants they all all all these were
attempts to to take what each of these various prophets and and and uh and
mistair took to be the the essence of what was happening in most the um the
the the the essential aspect of this of this spiritual Revival that was going on in which they saw as being at the root
of all the reform movement um to me the most interesting of them all is Charles
forier uh probably some of you have heard me talk about if you've been to any of my lectures before you probably
heard me talk about forier I'm completely obsessed with him um I find
him to be the most sympathetic and the most interesting of all the mid 19th century utopian
socialists again he's mostly remembered only because uh marks and Engles at one point had a few uh positive words for
him and then later on they denounced him as uh uh uh in fact Marx even used the
phrase I believe stench of the brothel in connection with
forier yeah you know Marx was a right old Puritan himself in a lot of ways
forier had his big Revelation he was born well back in in the 18th century he was really a very 18th century kind of
man but he had a long life he survived into the 1840s again and in 1799 just on
the brink of the 19th century he had his big Revelation which uh had to do mostly
with or he's mostly remembered for his theory of attractive labor by which he
meant that if uh that if everyone did exactly what they want to
do what they're most attracted to do that this would solve all the miseries
of industrial capitalism as it was then emerging and although this may seem like
a a simple-minded idea the more you think about it the more I think about it the more it unfolds into one of the most
brilliant insights that that any human being has ever had uh what it what it
really means it's a it's a a terrific wonderful Anarchist idea that if you do
what you what you truly desire if everyone does what they truly desire Society will automatically start to fall
into a state of Harmony because if you're doing what you desire why would you want to hurt anybody else why would
you want to take anything away from anybody else uh why would there why would there be undue competition why
would there be uh classism racism sexism whatever whatever whatever forier was
far in advance of the other reformers on every one of these subjects uh he was
the first uh sexual reformer uh he in apparently invented
the word feminism or so some French feminist theorists say to to this day
the French feminist theorists are great admirers of forier because he said that you could judge the state of a society
by the way women were treated in it and and uh he thought that mon monogamous
marriage was uh the worst trick that Civilization had played on Humanity that
it limited people to um to um narrow uh
contentious little monatic households where everything was moralism and
misery uh and that the the what people really wanted was
orgies and if they could have orgies then everyone would be happy and therefore society would fall into a
state of harmonious Bliss uh he also and and this is what
interests us particularly tonight I I wish I you know again if we had infinite number of lectures I could could say
quite a lot about forier and I will by the way be giving a lecture on forier and
surrealism uh in December if you uh I'm not exactly sure when it is part of the
anarchist Forum lecture series not here no I'll U I'll announce it on the radio
I'm not sure of the exact date but fora as you probably sorry oh uh my program is every other
Monday at 11:45 p.m. on WBAI 99.5
Fm and I'm going to be on again on the
7th October October 7th Monday October 7th I don't know when I'll know know the
date of this lecture it should it'll be either the uh 3rd or fifth Thursday in
in uh December um I talk about forier every chance I get he's an he wrote a
unbelievable amount of huge amount of stuff he never uh he never had any
success it wasn't until he was an embittered old man that he had a that he got a few disciples clustered around him
and he couldn't stand them uh they were a constant disappointment to him uh because by this
time I have to say even as a I I bow to no one in my admiration for forier uh a
real crank a real I mean why not say it he was mad uh but with a kind of Madness
that you know in my mind is tantamount to beautiful poetic Revelation and he had a very
very extremely original spiritual aspect to his teaching um he was recognized as a
Messiah by uh almost literally as a Messiah by large uh contingents of the
French what was left of the French hermetic movement he was seen to by them
to be some kind of a a new prophetic voice Reviving ancient wisdom he himself
had never read as far as I can make out a single word of any hermetic text uh he
had uh no respect for any of these people uh he uh was only interested in his own
ideas and he thought that his own ideas were completely new and original he didn't uh he didn't admit uh to
influence from anybody except a tiny tiny bit from rouso and even him he trashed um and he certainly wasn't going
to admit that he had been influenced by paracelis or uh or or or Claude enry
Martin of the famous founder of the martinist movement or and he or
swedenborg a lot of people immediately compared him to swedenborg and he had never heard of swedenborg and no
interest in being compared to swedenborg but he was recognized by all these people as a wonderfully fresh new and
original voice that sounded to them like hermeticism and uh this of course is
something that marks and angles and that whole crowd in their talk about forier completely covered up and in doing that
they were only part of a very Grand forist tradition because most of for's disciples covered it up too it was very
embarrassing to them um they took his theories of Labor of attractive labor which I said really was his perhaps his
most brilliant single insight and they made that into a movement uh which which I'll describe in
some detail but uh his sexual ideas and his cosmological ideas his spiritual
religious ideas they they didn't want anybody to know about so for example when his Works were translated from
French into English a lot of the most interesting stuff was dropped uh and has only been
rediscovered since the 1960s when some people began to delve into the unpublished
manuscript um including a whole huge book called the new world of love in which he uh he devoted the entire book
to his thoughts about sexuality which has not been translated into English it's a project that I have in mind uh
who knows um a few there is nothing in print by forier in English it's it's really an
awful shame and no complete work there is a an anthology which you might be
able to find that was published in the 70s but it still turns up there's obviously stock somewhere and it still
turns up in some bookstores from time to time it's called the utopian vision of
Charles forier and it's edited by Jonathan beer B we c h
e I can't remember the publisher beer also has a biography of Charles forier
which is just called Charles forier uh which is out in paper back from University of California if I'm not
mistaken um that's around that's in print it's an excellent book f o u r i e
r no relation to the mathematician of the same
name forier um so his his ideas about COs
ology I just just to give you a very brief uh example uh or a brief description he
thought that planets were living beings I'm going to have a lot more to say about this in the last lecture so I don't want to go into it in great detail
now um he thought that the Earth and all the other planets were living beings
that they communicated uh through space via Aroma smell rays of what he called
aromal Rays uh now Earth has been so screwed up
by the horrors of civilization that our aromal Ray is no longer functioning and
if you want to see it in its present state it is in fact the Northern Lights it's uh it should be shooting out from
the poles in almost laser like from the descriptions it almost sounds as if he
had visualized laser light um uh but because of because of our own stupidity
in allowing civilization to take over the world World um we have actually influenced the ecology porier was one of
the first philosophers to actually think about ecology uh about why the weather and
nature and so forth and so on the relationship between industry and nature it was one of the very first to even
imagine that there could be such a relationship and as usual with him he went way too far and uh cooked up these
amazing ideas about you know aromal rays and the northern lights and so forth but the basic Insight was a fascinating one
and that is that uh and one for which Marx I believe did give him credit which
was that U industry could have an influence that that that industry in the broad sense of the word human work human
activity could actually have an influence on the environment in fact he predicted that uh Factory growth of
population in factories would cause the climate to become warmer which is you know something that
a lot of people are talking about now so uh every once in a while when you're reading you waiting through this amazing
surrealist barrage of ideas you come across something which is like you know
just an out andout prediction of the future he has a lot of he's constantly doing it like I say you know he invented
uh the word feminism and uh uh he I don't know what he
uh what else did he uh foretell all kinds of all kinds of things I I'll have
more to say about him uh even within this lecture series um one important thing
that I should just note however is that he was not an atheist he thought that that Owen was a was um uh uh a devil uh
he hated Owen actually he hated everybody who didn't agree with him 100%
and no one could ever agree with him 100% uh he was a pretty testy individual
I think although I certainly think I could have gotten along with him
um he he did believe in God uh the question is what kind of a God was it
that he believed in he called he what basically what he said was there must be
a God for the following logical reasons
um if there were no such thing as Divine Providence then Harmony which is what he
called his ideal utopian state would never come into being in other words uh
for harmony to be realized every individual must at least potentially have access to an infinite
Bounty of uh of good things both in the material and the spiritual sense and if
uh this were not the case then God would be unjust which you know as the old school
men used to say quo absor absor absor aest which is absurd it's you the
you either have no God or you have a just God there's no such thing as an unjust God in this so in effect forier
himself proposed uh a kind of religion uh based on on his view of God
and and he did he did give a lot of thought he was totally obsessive in imagining how the details of his world
as it would come into existence um and one of the things that he imagined was the cultic aspect of of
that world the interesting thing about forier and one and and something an interesting point about
forier which some people have not understood is that although his world is exceedingly
structured it is not authoritarian it has a structure but it does not have a
hierarchy and this was such a diffic this was such a new idea that a lot of people totally missed it and they saw
forier as some kind of insane control freak who wanted everybody to be doing I mean uh he had schedule worked out you
know he believed that in in the future everyone would want at least 30 different jobs uh and that we would only be
sleeping two or three hours a night so because of our improved Health from his
um diet special diet called which he called the gastrosoph uh diet the the
wisdom of the stomach uh which uh for that word for the invention of that word
alone he deserves to be remembered and revered gastrosoph uh in in fact his cousin he he he he was
actually related to briat savaran who um who was who's who is known as as the
most brilliant writer on food of that period who wrote a book called The physiognomy of taste anybody ever read
that physiognomy of taste wonderful book isn't it I mean it's just gorgeous book
it was buat savaran who brought forier to Paris and introduced him to good food
and uh later on forier did him the honor of dismissing him and saying saying that
briat saaran didn't understand anything but he mentioned his name which he almost never did with anybody
else uh he in all of his Works he mentions rouso
briefly uh with I mean with some some kind of positive nod even if it's a
combined with a slap the composer Gluk because he believed that Opera was the
ultimate art form he oh that's another thing that he foresaw was the whole vagian theory of the Opera as the
complete art form and Gluk was as close as at God in those days so he was an admirer of Gluk and
um uh and so so on and so forth I just find him a totally magical figure as
incidentally did Andre Breton who I'll talk about that the the founder of
surrealism was a big forier fan I'll I'll talk about that particular aspect
of it more in in uh in December anyway he did have this idea of a religion it
was sort of a religion of Labor in in the in the shrine rooms there would be busts and portraits of people who had
done great heroic deeds in labor now this sounds very much like you know Marxist stavit you know with the hero of
Labor with the you know the sledgehammer you know and but that's not the way for saw it um he didn't like heavy industry
Al he he really thought that Arbor culture was where was what human work should really be like in other words the
cultivation of fruit trees uh which again is is fascinating in in the light the a lot of uh that
certain contemporary anthropologists or paleoanthropologists have hypothesized
an arboricultural period between the Stone Age and the age of
Agriculture um so that if for forier forier also understood he was one of the
first people to understand that uh this the so-called Savages like the tahitians
who had just recently been written about and and the works of Captain Cook had been translated into French uh when he
was a young man uh were so much better off than the people of the Civilized world that in that sense he was a rousan
and um uh he believed somewhat in the noble savage although he said that even
if the if the in fact he said that if the tahitians were given the option to lead the way into harmony that they
would of course go they would do it even more more quickly than civilized men because they were less
corrupt uh he so he uh he had this he had an idea once again just as he was a
sort of Pioneer in thinking about ecology he was also very much a Pioneer and thinking positively about uh people
who were being oppressed by Colonial imperialism and he thought that was terrible that these people should be um
forced to go through the period of civilization when as he put it they could leap in one magnificent bound from
savagery to Harmony uh so it wasn't wasn't exactly the same idea that we now hold let's say
of Native American wi shamanistic wisdom but was on the road to that just as he was on the road to feminism and on the
road to sexual Liberation interesting he was the the first and for a long time
the only social reformer to defend homosexuality I mean this was totally
unheard of until Emma Goldman U said a few Brave words about it in the
1920s uh before that forier was the only one to and but of course he also
supported every kind of sexual Mania as he called it um it was all it was all
good in harmony it was all good uh when he analyzed the marqu Assad and Nero for
example he said that in harmony these would be the most brilliant and uh of of of all the harmoni because they clearly
were people who had so many passions and if they weren't if they if their passions were not perverted and soured
by civilization they would turn out to be heroes of Harmony so uh I which I think actually
is one of the most interesting critiques anyone's ever made of the Marquee dad and he was the first again the first
author to to criticize the Marquee dad to to take Dad
seriously uh in a way doad is a kind of gloomy version I mean a kind of hideous you know nasty version of Foria you have
the the living together in a in a in you know in the castle you know the image of
the The Libertines Gather in the castle forier also believed that we would live
together in what he called fanies uh uh which he modeled on versil
the Palace of versil because he thought that uh in his estimation that was the most beautiful and luxurious building he
had ever seen and he thought that was the minimum that every human being deserved uh so his and also because of a
certain cosmological aspect to the
shape sort of you know a ma a main building that was arranged like that and then out buildings that would be
arranged like that and the whole when you when you read his cosmological um
ideas about the solar he believed that when Harmony is achieved on Earth the solar the planets would move closer to
Earth everything would get more cozy and um he he didn't like the moon he thought
that our present moon was dead and uh was a disgrace and it should be gotten rid of and replaced by five new moons
and so the sky the night sky that he visualizes is just amazing it's it's full of planets that would look about
that big you know instead of that big and you'd see Saturn with all its rings just you know and you'd see the five
moons each one a different color uh Violet umber blue you know um and and so
all so his the Filan was like the microcosm of which the solar system was
the macrocosm and in uh in Harmony human beings would move closer together and
become Cozier very cozy indeed and uh
and uh so so that the the very shape of the house that we would live in would be symbolic of the shape of the solar
system which would be symbolic of the shape of the universe which was symbolic of the shape of the Multiverse which was
I he had a truly Hindu scale in his cosmological thinking that that uh uh
very few of his contemporaries could match so um again I could I could rattle
on about for8 for quite a while but what time is it getting to be okay all right let me let me uh get
to uh some specific examples now of what I've been talking about and we hopefully
get through those in time for uh whatever questions or discussion might uh develop um forier
forer for for arism was yet another one of the waves of enthusiasm that swept across the burnover district uh at at a
certain time there were three or four fanies in Rochester alone however there
were also there was probably about somewhere between 30 and 40 forist uh phanies in America in between
oh 18 1843 and 1855 it had a brief run for its money uh
didn't work uh for reasons that 4A had predicted by the way but I won't go into that um it was a was a failure but it
was a certainly a glorious failure and some of the fanies actually did Thrive
for quite some time one of the best known was the North American faank which was right over the water in New Jersey
was mostly started by New Yorkers and that lasted the whole length
of the movement from about 43 to 55 I can't give you the exact dates now but it was it was quite
successful uh was in um the town the town is now known as red Red Hook Red
Red Bank thank you um I I still haven't managed to get over there so I'm not
exactly sure whether there's anything to be seen I think that there's not uh the County Historical Society preserves a
few momentos but the building the the main building burned down in as late as
1975 and a lot of the people who when the when the thing was dissolved in 1855 a lot of the people settled down in that
region because they liked their life there and they didn't want to leave it something very common in the history of
American Utopias is that when the when the strictly utopian period of a community
ends um you know the people don't leave they settle down and try to hang on to a
few shreds of of the Community uh spirit that they had and that happened at the
North American um Haywood Brown uh a now largely
forgotten writer prominent 1940s and 50s actually grew up in Red Bank and his
parents had been uh North American uh fail lanks members and there was a
couple of other well-known people who came out of that as well uh probably however the the most
famous forier Community was Brook Farm and this is something which people forget they they Brook Farm is called
the transcendentalist commune but at a certain point they switched over from transcendentalism which in any case was
never an organized movement in the sense of some of these other movements but it was more of a
feeling and they specifically adopted forist uh
ideology and uh um I think Brook Farm is probably the most attractive of all the
uh faanes and the one in which you can get an idea of what life should have been sort of developing
towards if you read uh any of the Memoirs of Brook Farm except for that awful bdale Romance by Hawthorne which
is uh really a terrible U uh liel on Brook Farm in my opinion um
and unfortunately probably the most famous account but there are plenty of firstperson narratives that that came
out of Brook Farm there was a very high degree of literacy there they tended to be Boston
intellectuals uh and there the whole thing was that they were getting out into the country and you know working on
the farm was good for intellectuals to get out in the country and work on the farm uh not in any kind of nasty Mau you
know cultural revolution way but out of a kind of joy and nature mysticism out
of a rediscovery of the joys of working with green things and you know getting your hands dirty and so forth and so on
there was enough of them there so that even though they worked pretty hard they didn't have to overdo it you know they didn't have to spend all their time like
some poor New England farmer with a nuclear family who has to take care of the you know the the wife and husband
are the only ones there to plow the fields and take care of the cows and that's a pretty miserable existence but
the brook farmers were able to share out those duties and uh have plenty of time it would seem judging from the Diaries
and and firsters narratives for picnics and walks in the the woods and love affairs and uh U of course again forer's
more U radical thinking didn't get translated into America and most of the
brook farmers were even completely unaware of the orgiastic aspects of of
forier thinking so you mustn't get the idea that there was a you know a hot bed
of free love although uh that came a little later Brook Farm was not like
that Brook Farm was settled by by very serious mostly Christian
perfectionist Boston um people who had escaped from their puran Heritage either into
Unitarianism or one of those transitional kind of churches univers universalists were another one and then
eventually like Emerson following along his path he had he had uh come from
congregationalist family and then he himself had been a Unitarian Minister and finally he had to quit Unitarianism
because even that was too organized and Doctrine for him and a lot of the
uh yes the the ceiling's leaking the music is playing a total Madness but
never mind um so uh Brook Farm only failed really
because they had a terrible fire there or I mean that was you know what what apparently did did them in uh if it if
it hadn't been for that I think Brook Farm would have probably carried on for quite a while because even though the
the farm wasn't doing that brilliantly they had founded a school again on forist principles forier was again an
amazing Pioneer in Educational Theory uh and uh that school had proven
to be very very successful and uh was drawing in uh kids from all over the Boston area whose parents wanted some
you know wanted them to have a more joyful education than was available at let's say Boston Latin you know or
whatever the Alternatives would have been and uh if it hadn't been for the fire I think that that school alone
would have probably carried Brook Farm along and it was the school was uh was
imitated by other utopians uh yeah where was Brook Farm Brook Farm was in in a
suburb of Boston and there are there is a bit a bit to see there there's a few
few buildings survived well it's not far from
Lennox um what is the name of the town that it was in let just escaped me look
it up in the in the britanica you'll find an entry there I'm sure uh it's undoubtedly worth
worth a visit even now and the uh that's great uh thank you
and a little obligato there um the farthest reach the farthest
reach of the forer movement was that it was Wisconsin where I was this summer I
didn't get to the site there but I understand there's something to see there and I hope to get to it next year
um the Wisconsin fail lank was also very successful and one of the more
successful ones in this case because it was founded by very sober-minded Wisconsin Dairy Farmers who knew exactly
what they were doing they' been swept away by forist enthusiasm uh but they still remained
very practical uh uh gents and they they knew had a farm already they weren't just thumbless intellectuals from the
city you know they so uh they were hard and they made they made quite a success of the Wisconsin and when they dissolved
it for per reasons of I think personal animosities that had Arisen uh actually
they they they all withdrew with a profit uh they actually made a profit on it and a lot of them settled down and
that was in near Greenbank uh uh Wisconsin Green Bay
Green Bay Wisconsin where the foot the football team comes from right
um so uh uh and generally speaking the four aists uh were hospitable to the
whole idea of religious toleration um they allowed uh people
with with with a wide range of of religious INSP spiritual interests to settle with them and indeed many of them
were also involved in spiritualism and other uh um um you know religious or
quasi religious uh movements of to day probably the most fascinating of all the
spiritualist communes was Onida uh which again still could still
be said to exist as a silverware company yep Onida silverware from
upstate New York um it's my am my ambition to get a complete set uh so I
can have you utopian silverware um Onida was founded by uh just a really
fascinating character named John Humphrey noise who had been through this entire Burnt Over experience he had
started out started out being uh started out being deeply involved in the revivalist movement as as a young
Christian uh Enthusiast and then he had moved on from there to become a perfectionist and in fact to become the
leading uh uh Theologian SL ideologist of the perfectionist movement in as much
as that was a movement and not just a a trend or tendency and um he also as it turned out
had a genius for organization and he he he founded Onida
in well actually he started with with an abortive version in in ver Vermont and
sort of got chased out of town by the usual torch wielding you know uh Puritans in this case uh was still too
close to Old New England so he moved to what was really the new New England few
miles north of Rochester and uh and founded Onida where uh he decided to go the
whole hog and declare that the U the age of of uh of monagas marriage was over
and that his followers would practice what he called complex marriage which meant that everybody at Onida was at
least potentially married to everybody else at Onida and uh in in effect uh as far as
this has been studied and of course it has this this particular story has been studied because you know it's got a little spicy
aspect to it which has attracted historians so you'll you'll actually find more bibliography on on Onida than
a lot of the other also it lasted longer was tremendously successful uh it was one of the wackiest
in terms of its actual practice and one of the most successful in terms of its economic history so you know that throws
a monkey wrench in a lot of the critiques that were made of the communal communalist movement because U the idea
that the communes failed because the of these rigid cranky ideologies just doesn't wash in the case of Onida they
had one of the most rigid and most cranky of all the ideologies and they were also one of the most successful
communes um anyway the way it worked was this um it was not an anarchist setup um
uh John Humphrey noes did have uh executive power there but if you didn't
agree with it agree with him you could leave and you know no more than two or three people left in the whole history
of the commune so uh clearly he was a charismatic uh oddly enough levelheaded
you know even one would almost say rational uh thinker if it weren't for
the fact that he had these totally bizarre thoughts um so he would you know uh he
or one of the older members would help you find a temporary uh mate
for sexual purposes and exclusive relationships were frowned on and it was
thought to be better for everyone to love everyone else so uh it was an attack on romantic love a very
interesting you know in view of the the critiques of romantic love that have happened in the 20th century I think
this was very much a precursor of that critique of romantic love and exclusive
love of the sort that leads to monogamous marriage and
um a feminist's critique a feminist would at this point immediately say aha yes but this is like sexual freedom for
the for for men but women get pregnant and so therefore you know it's not sexual freedom for women right noise
figured that out almost immediately he was very smart uh and and in fact in his
own sexual relations he realized this with with extreme poignant and so he
developed what he called male continents uh which
essentially historians are still a little vague about exactly what this was because they couldn't really describe it
in graphic detail in their Publications um there you know it was just you couldn't talk about penises and
vaginas that openly in Publications in the 19 in 19th century America although
things were not nearly as uptight and Victorian as you might imagine but as far as as far as we can
we you know enthusiasts for nid of History can make out what it meant
really was uh uh cus interruptus um but would the Intercourse
would be carried on for very long periods of time and noise thought that
the female orgasm was very important and uh in this he was again uh very much a
Pioneer I mean forier would have would have agreed and I think even does discuss it in some place in his writings
but noise in terms of in in Americans certainly amongst Christians and he never he never denied
you know he never gave up being a Christian he was always and he and his followers were always extremely enthusiastic mystical perfectionist
Christians uh so the um and apparently
this was you know this apparently provided uh the men claimed that this provided even greater pleasure than they
were used to and I think that might have something to do with the sort of you know lack of understanding of
interesting foreplay and stuff like that you know that this was sort of the invention of foreplay in
America uh recently I met and I'm not allowed to say who this is but because
he's he's a he doesn't want word to get out that he's saying these things but he's someone who worked for the modern
day Onida Corporation whom I met recently who uh uh is also an amateur
historian and and interviewed a lot of the uh surviving uh uh descendants of
the original uh uh colonists and he said that the real secret of Onida was oral
sex but uh I don't know that's oral sex
right um so that nothing of that appears in the literature believe that I can say
I was totally shocked when I heard this I had no idea um so anyway uh these ideas also
rediscovered through Oriental you know um the DST uh yoga sexual yoga
techniques tantric sexual yoga techniques the movement back in the 6s called careta some of you might might
remember k a r e z Za a uh again there's this idea of male continence
or sort of extended Kus interruptus or whatever you want to call it is uh turns
out to be uh much more widespread than noise knew noise thought he this had
come to him in a revelation direct from on high and he as far as he knew he had invented
this uh anyway this this this uh this technique bizarre as it may be made a
lot of people and we're talking about hundreds of people now this got to be a very large and successful Community very
happy for for decades and and again it was uh it was torch wielding Puritans
you know who who put the kabash on it and uh scared poor John Humphrey so
badly that he fled the country and uh uh died in Canada um but uh the his
son uh whose name I forget well noise you
know he had many sons actually um and daughters one of them oh
Pier Pont noise Pier Pont noise turned out to be a brilliant businessman and
although they uh they stopped with the with the the complex marri marriage they kept the community together to to make
the silverware and other stuff and uh pure Pont noise survived into the 20th century and turned the whole thing into
a very successful rather unusual because
community-based um Factory and as such survives to this day
even with still a few remnants of communal idealism apparently so my informant uh told
me um so that was probably the apotheosis of perfectionism and of social reform of
free love which was by the way I forgot to mention free love which was another one of the big movements uh and that which gets me back
to Victoria Woodhull who was uh an um a a promulgator of the free love
movement this did not mean what it meant in the 60 1960s or what it means today
know it just it didn't mean promiscuity and it didn't mean uh um sexual Liberation in the sense
that we might understand it it really meant a reform in the in the in the
structure of romantic love and mon monogamous marriage again which were the social forms that came under the most
profound criticism and um really by modern standards the free love movement was
pretty conservative in a lot of ways I mean some of the more extreme uh I
suppose you could say the right-wing of the free love movie was more concerned with for example the
evils of masturbation or of lesbianism or something I mean uh uh they thought
that uh perversion could be wiped out if only blah blah blah blah you know healthy heterosexual it's kind of I
don't know German sunlight and you know Purity kind of movement you know um but
there were more more daring uh versions of free love John Humphrey noise was one
Angela uh and Ezra Haywood were another another famous free love couple uh
published journals had experimental communities and so forth and so on were eventually destroyed by famous Anthony
comto uh who was the self-appointed censor of American literature for for
many many years and who comto literally drove Ezra Haywood to his grave had him
arrested over and over and over again for obscenity which at that time meant pamphlets on birth control that he would
send through the mail to anyone who asked for them and that happened to be illegal and so comto was able to get it
was still illegal when Emma Goldman and Margaret Sanger were doing it in the
early 20th century uh and comto was responsible for some of those laws made
use of other existing laws and literally drove Ezra Haywood to an early grave he
died in prison um horrible horrible story but
Victoria Wood hole had had um I guess she was a stronger character
Than Ezra Haywood she didn't let herself be pushed around by any man that's for sure um not only did she run for
president and run the American spiritualist movement she was also the first female stock broker on Wall
Street uh and um uh one of the founders of the last
commune that I'll mention to you modern times which was out in Brentwood Long Island and there's still a couple of
buildings to be seen there incidentally um they were very fond of of so-called octagon houses which were really
hexagons you've probably all seen some of these houses at one time and wondered how anybody could come up with such a a
wacky design well they they were the geodesic domes of the mid 19th century
hippie movement uh the Octagon houses were uh the the building of choice for
all these reform cranks uh they thought there was something I don't know I fig forget I could I'll look it I'll look it
up again there was some supposedly practical reasons why octagon houses were you know the architecture of the
future and there's a couple of them out in Brentwood which uh we could go see sometime uh so um modern times was
founded by uh uh one of Victoria Wood Hall's dearest friends and someone who
actually wrote wrote some of her presidentials uh campaign speeches and so forth a man named Steven Pearl
Andrews uh there is a book about Pearl Andrews which I know for a fact there
are some copies of in the Strand it's called the
pantar and um if my brain doesn't give out completely I might even remember the
author's name anyway uh I'll get that reference for anyone who's interested
Steven Pearl Andreas was a wonderful eccentric he he um there was no Reform
movement of the mid 19th century that Steven Pearl Andrews did not not only make his own but become a leader in
including phenology uh you know the reading of bumps on the head to determine character
which was very very important movement at the time hydropathy which was the
water cure uh which was an attack on on um
early Industrial Medicine actually made a lot of sense because alpath medicine at that time was really scary and
uh you know even if lying in in a bath of cold water didn't cure you of
anything at least it didn't kill you the way some of the official men yeah okay so there is a book on V on Victoria I
didn't know that um not surprised though because she was such a great and important
figure um and she was embroiled in a in a terrible free love Scandal um in Byzantine complex lexity
that uh uh thrilled the newspaper readers of New York City for for quite a number of
years and um it involved a um a member of the beeer famous Beacher family who
was a preacher in New York and uh who uh who she accused of having an adulterous
Affair even though he had condemned her for being a free lover so there that was the gist of it and then it went on it
got really complicated and people like Henry James senior were and uh
um uh go west Go West Young man um gy
Harris gley got involved in it gley by the way was a very enthusiastic supporter of forier and and many other reform
movements until he uh uh got involved in politics and lost his youthful
idealism um what else oh Ashley Pearl Andrews was
was also leading abolitionist he he done all kinds of exciting he had exciting
adventures in Texas and been chased out of Texas by the by the pro-slavery contingent there and uh oh he was
involved in alphabet reform he introduced Pitman Shand to America uh
shorthand was began as a as a supposedly crank uh reform idealistic idea now we
take it completely for granted um he also invented a universal language long before
U espiranto uh which was called alwat don't ask me
why and um all of these this incredible circus of ideas that Steven Pearl
Andrews stood for he mixed them all together in a cauldron and poured it out
in this immense indigestible book called uh the science of society and he called
it panarchy and him he himself was the pantar and once again like forier and in
fact I think based on forier um the titles were all kind of um good natured
uh jokes you appointed yourself to all the you know there was no uh author
authoritarian hierarchy involved here uh Pearl Andrews was an anarchist he was a
great admirer of Josiah Warren who's usually labeled as the first Anarchist in America although that's not true but
Pearl Andrew and and Warren were very close Warren had been a disciple of Owen
and had seen what a miserable failure communism was at New Harmony so he flip-flopped to The Other Extreme and
became interested in individualist anarchism and uh uh he converted to Pearl Andre but Pearl Andrew also very
influenced by forier there are passages in Pearl Andrew that I've found that are almost
word for word lifted from Foria even um Pearl Andrew was really a a a New York
beatnick he was one of the you know first of New York Bohemians uh he hung out downtown he had
a uh uh another Utopia called The Brownstone Utopia which was on East 14
Street somewhere I'm not exactly sure where I haven't tracked that down yet he was uh he was one of the first Bohemians
to hang around the sort of grenwich Village area uh I've been trying to trace exactly when Greenwich Village
became of bohemia and I think Pearl Andrew might have had something to do with it and um so he survived into the
post Civil War period in fact modern times was one of the last great mid 19th century experiments uh that actually
survived past the Civil War uh oh and uh the point also being
the panarchy again is a kind of spiritual movement and one of the many things that uh Pearl Andrews did was to
found something he called the universal Catholic Church Church which was to be uh an amalgamation of all world
religions and it was in fact as far as I can make out one of the very earliest uh
syncretistic religions that that took in Buddhism and Confucianism and things like that which are really only words to
Steven Pearl Andrews he didn't really I don't think he knew much about them but he had heard about Oriental religions
from transcendentalist uh thinkers like Emerson who did actually read a few
books and uh so he he you know mixed them in with with his religion which
unfortunately never really got off the ground apparently they had uh uh they
had meetings in New York City for a while but it was not one of his more successful ventures in fact none of his
Ventures were really successful except modern times uh which was um totally
fascinating completely Anarchist uh commune one of the very few pure
Anarchist communes where literally anything anything anything at all was allowed uh there was a a a a system of
Labor exchange based on Josiah Warren's ideas uh which was completely voluntary
it was the only structure that modern times really had and all every possible kind of crank and reformist came to
Modern Times uh there were free love people there were hydropathy people um
there was a represent representative of the Church of humanity which by this time had become heavily influenced by
comped uh there were um you know German heelan idealists uh there uh anarchists
abolitionists uh every every conceivable kind of eccentric and
Bohemian uh moved out to Modern Times And um much to Josiah Warren's disgust
because he was a kind of Durer Yankee inventor type and not at all interested in in in in orgism and uh he didn't he
thought that the whole free love thing was giving the commune a bad name and he was right and so the usual torch
wielders you know came and closed it down and uh uh but but again the people
who had had had such a wonderful time there tended to try to stay on and apparently there there are still
descendants of the settlers living out in Brentwood to this day and and pearl Andrews died there uh
in the uh in the home of one of his loyal dis IPL Les and with the death of
pearl Andrew and the by the way defalcation of Victoria Woodhall who uh
went over to England and married an aristocrat and became something of a reactionary and gave up most of her
radical ideas although she was still interested in being a powerful woman
um came to an end really the Glorious period of of 19th century uh reform and
and spiritual experimentation and uh it's very
interesting for me to come now to the history of the Civil War from the other end I mean we've always looked at the
Civil War from our end around and we've seen it as the um uh end of slavery and
the uh uh Triumph of Union and you know Union makes you strong and the slaves
are freed and Lincoln is this great humanitarian hero coming at it from the other end coming at it from the point of
view of of of somebody like a Steven Pearl Andrews who uh culminated and
synthesized the whole spiritual and radical reform movement of the 19th century the Civil War looks like a
horrible betrayal of all of this it looks like it was specifically cooked up on purpose to ruin this impending social
Revolution uh in a number of ways first of all by uh by amalgam by uh co-opting
all reform energy into uh a campaign that would be run by politicians and the military to
emancipate black slaves in the South now you know this is obviously an extremely
good cause one can have no quarrel with the cause of emancipation but it is uh interesting to
note that uh Lincoln himself was a blatant racist he thought that the blacks were were animals that should be
sent back to Africa uh he he there are quotes that you can get from Lincoln's
uh presidential addresses which would um sound ex disgusting even in the mouth of
a David Duke believe me he was uh he was a rabid
racist he was by no means a humanitarian hero he was a skunk like all Republicans
come on you know he was a politician he was interested in power and um he came
to power in a country that was threatened with dissolution was threatened with secession with breakup
not just from the south and the reactionary slaveholders of the South
but from all of these people as well I mean any one of these communal movements
could have become the germ of a a quote unquote secessionist movement that would
have broken up a unity in America that many people were still completely
unconvinced uh of its value um there were people who at that time
saw the Constitution as a betrayal of the truly Democratic and egalitarian
ideas of the Revolution there were people who uh very much thought that a
gigantic America spanning from coast to coast would be a a horrible mistake because any government that big would be
bound to be oppressive there were people who uh for various reasons be it anything from free
love to Communism to individualist anarchism or whatever were had
interested in breaking off from that Union uh uh either privately secretly to
be just let us alone we want to be out here in the woods doing our own thing or else like Victoria Woodhall wanted to
seize power so um the like all wars
especially in American history and you know the more I study it the more clear it becomes to me the Civil War was a
control mechanism it was brought into it was full forced into uh the the point
was was forced not only by the south as we're always taught to to label them the villains but by the north as well maybe
even especially by the north let's get this out in the open let's smash all resistance to the mega State let's get
capitalism really on the road the industrial capitalism was impossible to get on the road as long as there was a
RI whole rival economy in the South and a million minor rival econom economies in the reform
movement uh you know let's strip abolitionism of all its subtlety of all
its humanitarian real humanitarianism and reduce it only to a a crude moral
code which will free the black slaves and then do nothing for them as human
beings because essentially this whole uh thing was carried out by racists who hated
blacks uh and and you know you think Reconstruction was you know and and you think that segregation you think these
things were historical accidents this was part of the plan come on give me a break
uh that the Civil War was the uh plot of the emergent Republican party which is
still the Republican party of today don't don't let anybody tell you different to completely control Manifest
Destiny to conquer the entire Western Hemisphere and to impose a regime of
authoritarian uh industrial capitalism on on uh uh to destroy nature uh to uh
to you know to improve nature I.E to destroy it um the uh then the Civil War
looks like a real total disaster from this point of view it does not look like the great Triumph of of goodness and
light that it's presented even on PBS and the recent TV that you may have
seen um and I just think you know okay maybe I'm maybe I'm exaggerating for
effect here and because this may be an idea that you haven't come across before but I really think we should balance
this view of the civil war against the uh um uh you know uh official official
historical version of it as the great watermark in American freedom and democracy it was anything but and if you
want an example of how reform was destroyed um the emphasis on politics
and Military solutions to social problems which the Civil War prop pounded was taken up by the feminists
after the war who gave up entirely their critique of marriage and of sexuality
and put all their efforts into what suffrage voting you know which we now
know and we can now see as a total Croc of and a waste of time you know it it set the feminist movement back a
hundred years uh in my humble opinion you know I mean I'll be perfectly willing to accept
arguments from the audience on this one uh you know it's an arguable point but
it's one that that I've come to feel very strongly and I think if we go through the reform the reform movements
one by one and see what their their pre antibellum and postbellum faces are like
we'll see this happening again and again in every field I just picked feminism and and women's suffrage as one of the
most poignant examples uh but to uh to sum it up I
would say I read I read somewhere I wish I could remember who came up with this cute quote there is no new
age um what we now think of is the new age was already completely there in every single one of its aspects in the
middle of the 19th century we had hippie communes Allah everything from Onida to
free times uh modern times we had um uh sexual Liberation movements we had a
fascination with the occult and the Orient with you know there there it was let's say it was swedenborg and and uh
uh um um Perfection Christian perfectionism and now it's I don't know you know Buddhism and uh
um Crystal gazing but uh the the principles are the same and the range of
everything from silly uh from silliness to the sublime is also the same um to just to give you
one example um in the field of nature mysticism
which sometimes if you listen to a lot of our green prophets you know would you'd think was an invention of the 60s
at the at the earliest 1960s uh one of forer's enthusiastic
disciples uh for a time later went on to become Frederick Law Olstead the designer of Central Park a couple of you
some of you might have heard the paper that I read on the radio about Olstead and his forist background and forier
rather Olstead was uh not only founded the first urban park in
America um in order to bring the beauties of nature into the sad life of
early Capital industrial capitalism very specifically this was his specific
purpose he was also instrumental in founding one of the first national parks
in California when he had um a brief Adventure as the manager of a gold mine
in California and visited um um uh
I can't remember the uh the name of the park um y i I guess it's Yos yeah he
fell in love was his the place where he's working was very near yuse
no John well M was M was part of this too mure was on the committee Redwood
San Francisco no well I think it's your but
I'm not sure again I should have you know I just I'm really I apologize for my bad control over details tonight but
I haven't been able to get a chance to go through my books um but uh so Olstead took his
early experience with foyer ISM and the its thinking about environment and even
what we now call ecology and for him with his obsession with landscape he was a great artist of landscape in my
opinion uh turned that into a brilliant new idea which was the uh
I mean not entirely new but it was certainly new In America which was the idea of the public park that uh and in a
sense it you can see it as a response to The Disappearance of the frontier and the The Assault on nature that was being
carried out by industrial capitalism and for the first time I mean Olstead himself made it all the way to
California uh that it was it was the end the frontier had come to an end um uh
this the cities really were beginning to spread like some kind of hideous blight over what had once been Pleasant
Farmland of the Northeast um our our neck of the woods and so Olstead was was a
Pioneer in in responding to this disappearance of nature really you could
you could criticize him for for commod for for making nature into a commodity you know for making nature into yet
something else that the emergent capitalist Nation could buy you got enough money you can buy a
bit of Nature and plop it down in the middle of New York City uh all right that's the negative side if we're want
to look at it you know get a dialectics of Central Park going here that would be the negative side of it but after all we
live here we know what the positive side is if it wasn't for Central Park probably half of us would be insane by
now am I right uh I mean that's the way I've always felt I've always felt deeply grateful about Central Park and as soon
as I realized that it was designed by a forist the whole thing fell into place I mean the
um you know I now feel that I understand the whole Landscaping that went into it it is in fact meant to be the grounds of
a faank of an ideal faank um The Farms would be lying even
farther out on another belt uh but the the Central Park is like the lawn of a
faank which isn't there but which has been replaced instead by the whole population of New York so um the the
idealism and the Beautiful idealism that went into into Central Park uh really uh
should be attributed to this whole spiritual uh Reform movement that that I've that I've tried to uh to describe
and I think you know we could do no better than to to repeat again that there is no new age uh that it's all
happened before that we all have many many ancestors uh in in the um uh work that
we undertake in a place like this and the more we know about them and the what where they went wrong and what failures
they had and what success as they had the better it is for us in in in the work that we try to carry out so um this
lecture makes a link hopefully between America's mythological hermetic uh
beginnings and what we'll get to in the last lecture which will be a pical attempt to bring this all back to life
in a in a way that has some chance of success and so we'll I'll leave I'll leave the 19th century now and uh uh
questions anybody I was just going to make another observation about Central Park and the work
that to know that every single tree ined by
the oh yes and it was it was it was it was previously even
yeah yes well interestingly enough the uh the the nasty side of it is that a um
a tri-racial squatter's Village was kicked out of the way to make Central Park it was called senica Village and it
was inhabited by uh Native Americans and blacks and poor whites Irish probably
and um they were they were pushed out to make room for Central Park but yes uh uh
Olstead and vo VA his partner and another really fascinating character
who's totally forgotten now named Ray mold uh who had been in Spain studying
Islamic architecture and brought a lot of Mor influence into Central Park which
you can still see around the central Fountain uh all all three of them I think brilliant and uh except for
Alstead who's finally getting some do U you know underrated Geniuses of the
period
yeah well he designed that too yeah uh Central Park has been screwed
around with a lot most recently by Moses Robert Moses really screwed around with Central Park and destroyed destroyed a
lot more than go Prospect Park I believe I'm right in saying is more is actually
closer to the elstead vau design yeah right right
right meow is the longest expansive space in any part of day un
and I remember once going before I knew going to the top of the a PE kind of in
the middle of it IMM and can see this was designed for
for for my ability to be able to come
absolutely yeah yeah the same thing was done in Central Park though it's just uh the the buildings around Central Park
were meant to be totally blocked so you could walk down in the middle of it and you would be in Pure Country and there's
still there's still Vistas where where that's possible despite the newer larger buildings that have sprung up blah blah blah what's the what's the best book uh
well there's a very nice biography of Olstead called FL by a woman author
whose Name Escapes me but I found it in the strand for like 15 bucks it's a huge
book uh and um the uh book where I first
caught on to to olmstead's uh forier background was in uh a book called The
utopian alternative by Carl gueri Gua n r
i and he used the F he used that book Flo as his main source along with the
papers of Frederick lad which have some interesting for fistic writings in them
yeah you know you know talking about America the Civil War destroying all
these movements indictive you know
yeah absolutely running that's another key to
the absolutely that was very very uh uh harmonious with forier ideas and I think
probably comes directly yeah yeah yeah uh yeah I wanted to ask you that
somebody always feel person who a Sweden ber or
something uh John Chapman who ran all all around the country uh planting app oh Johnny app
yes I've heard that he was a Sweden borgan I don't know again if there is a monograph or book on him I haven't uh
you know a definitive books about but I don't know if anything like totally like says what he what he agreed with about
swedenberg I don't know his parents were swedenberg de you swedenborgians or whatever and he
supposedly was like you know took the philosophy a step further and something that he was obsessed with apples I guess
and another thing well forier forier was obsessed with apples too so it's it's conceivable that uh like many people
like Andrew like Andrew Jackson Davis for example that I mentioned before that his thinking might have been uh a mix of
swedenborg and forier forier claimed that his original Insight came to him when he was comparing the price of
prices of apples in Paris and the and the the country side so he said there
there have been three great apples in history ad Adam's Apple uh um who was it
you know gravity Newton's Apple and and his Apple so uh in the in the book uh in
the anthology of his writing utopian vision of of of Charles forier there's a picture of of apples on the cover for
this reason yeah um you know a connection with William Blake and any of
these mov uh Blake um I I frequently had occasion
to compare forier and Blake I I think that forier is deserving of Interest as
a as a Visionary thinker as much as Blake and I find them to be very similar characters and uh I even had a a vision
once of forier and Blake playing miniature golf together and uh uh it
seemed somehow to really work I don't know why and uh uh but Blake Blake's
interest is is interesting among many other reasons because he came before all this I mean he really was a prophetic
figure and a real link as U uh some British historian a British
historian named Morton has pointed out about Blake that he was a real link between the uh radical Protestant sects
of the 17th century and the uh romantic you know romantic uh reformists of the
19th century he stood in a pivotal position at least in the English tradition so that he brought a lot of
very typical Ranter Digger you know mugal tonian fifth monarchy type of
material out of the 17th century at least Morton says so and uh uh
transmogrified it in his own system and then passed it on through the romantics right to the extreme radicals
of the early 19th century and especially to the revolutionaries of 48 and of course Blake was a good friend of Thomas
Payne as you probably know when Payne left America he stayed with Blake when he had to escape from England Blake
helped him Escape uh Blake was was extreme radical
revolutionary so he ties together this you know Protestant mysticism uh Proto revolutionary
thinking and uh um you know Visionary utopian U uh mystique and and creativity
artistic creativity all these themes are are are met in Blake as a kind of Nexus or
pivotal figure and his his period of activity was earlier than forier
by half a generation but as far as I know there was no connection no no no no
connection for for one thing forier could not read any other language but French and I don't think Blake could
read anything except English although he might have known a little Latin I guess it's getting late do you
want to any well okay okay two more questions you guys
yes start invol civil war do that that wasn't the program but as it became the
program dolence
think maybe maybe again I was exaggerating for effect I just I would
like to uh you know deconstruct a little bit Lincoln's uh image is the great
emancipator what yes yes absolutely if you if you really if you want really want to challenge me on this I'll track
down this you know yeah I mean you're not going to get this from the Carl Sandberg version you
know uh
oh right okay and one last
Justman connection with Emon transcendal was he involved with anything
absolutely U just this summer I got the key from Alan Ginsburg who pointed out
that Whitman adopted the butterfly as his symbol butterfly yeah right and the
Butterfly was also an extremely important symbol for for Foria and it's gin Ginsburg Ginsburg has done as as as
you probably know real work on Whitman and it's his opinion that Whitman was influenced by
Foria uh uh so you know I'll take his word for it so uh see you in a week when we'll do
the
Illuminati""

    <h2>Comprehensive Analysis of Hakim Bey’s Anarchist Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
        Hakim Bey, also known as Peter Lamborn Wilson, presents a multifaceted critique of modern society through an anarchist lens, focusing on themes such as capitalism, technology, media, spirituality, and the pursuit of autonomy. His philosophy weaves together historical analysis, cultural commentary, and philosophical reflections to challenge prevailing power structures and envision alternative paths toward genuine freedom and resistance.
    </p>
    <h3>Core Themes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Capitalism as Manipulation of Desire</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scarcity and Utopian Promises:</strong> Bey critiques capitalism for artificially exacerbating desire by creating false scarcity and unattainable utopian ideals. This manipulation fuels endless consumerism without true fulfillment, trapping individuals in a cycle of perpetual want.</li>
                <li><strong>Alienation and Commodification:</strong> Capitalism interrupts natural reciprocity and exploits creativity, alienating individuals from their bodies and lived experiences. It commodifies art, culture, and meaning, reducing rich human expressions to marketable goods devoid of genuine significance.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Capitalism as Spectacle</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Images Without Substance:</strong> Capitalism operates on a superficial level of images detached from reality. It turns life into a spectacle, reducing meaning to flat, commodified representations that lack depth and authentic connection to lived experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Tourism and Soul Loss:</strong> The commodification of experiences, such as in tourism, reduces cultures to mere images, perpetuating sameness and contributing to a loss of authentic cultural identity.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Neoliberalism and Postmodernism</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ideological Domination:</strong> Neoliberal capitalism has shed its ideological pretenses, engaging in direct domination while presenting itself as the only viable system.</li>
                <li><strong>Rejection of Modernist Insights:</strong> Bey critiques the abandonment of critical theories in favor of superficial narratives that sustain capitalism.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Capitalism’s Spiritual Dimensions</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gnostic Ideology:</strong> Bey likens capitalism to a gnostic religion that promotes disembodiment and false transcendence. 
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gnosticism Defined:</strong> Gnosticism is a religious philosophy that sees the material world as flawed or corrupt, created by a lesser deity (the Demiurge), and emphasizes the pursuit of transcendence or enlightenment in a higher, spiritual realm.</li>
                <li><strong>Capitalism as Modern Gnosticism:</strong> Bey compares capitalism to Gnosticism because it devalues the material world (physical relationships, tangible goods, lived experiences) and instead promotes a false sense of transcendence, particularly through consumerism and abstract systems like finance or media.</li>
                <li><strong>Disembodiment and Alienation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Detachment from physical, material reality.</li>
                        <li>Alienation from one’s own body, labor, and immediate experiences.</li>
                        <li>Replacement of tangible fulfillment with abstract promises (e.g., success, wealth, or happiness through endless consumption).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Virtual Capital and Alienation:</strong> Bey critiques the financialization of the global economy, where capital exists increasingly as an abstraction—in the form of stocks, digital currencies, and speculative assets—rather than being tied to the material production of goods or services. 
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cyber-Gnostic Heaven:</strong> The virtual, intangible realm where wealth and value are divorced from physical reality, leading to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The sidelining of material needs (housing, healthcare, meaningful work) in favor of speculative financial systems.</li>
                        <li>Alienation from the tangible world as daily lives become dominated by abstract systems and values.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Implications for Alienation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Capitalism teaches people to aspire to a false ideal of transcendence (through consumption or financial success) while ignoring the material and social realities that sustain well-being.</li>
                        <li>Individuals become disconnected from their embodied existence and communities, leading to deeper psychological and spiritual alienation.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Critical Analysis of the Gnosticism-Capitalism Comparison</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>True Parallels:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Detachment from the Material World:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Gnosticism:</strong> The material world is seen as flawed, created by a lesser deity, with salvation achieved by transcending it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Capitalism:</strong> Encourages prioritizing abstract goals (wealth, success, virtual goods) over tangible engagement with community, nature, and embodied experiences.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Promise of Transcendence:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Gnosticism:</strong> Seeks personal enlightenment through secret knowledge.</li>
                        <li><strong>Capitalism:</strong> Offers the promise of success through material wealth, though often elusive.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Alienation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Gnosticism:</strong> Views the self as trapped in a flawed material world.</li>
                        <li><strong>Capitalism:</strong> Creates alienation through labor separation, mediated relationships, and commodified experiences.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Where the Comparison Breaks Down:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Material World in Gnosticism:</strong> Gnosticism rejects the material world for spiritual truths, while capitalism commodifies and exploits it.</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose of Transcendence:</strong> Gnosticism seeks liberation and enlightenment; capitalism fosters cycles of debt and consumerism.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on Spirituality vs. Profit:</strong> Gnosticism aims for truth, while capitalism exploits illusions for profit.</li>
                <li><strong>Critique of Authority:</strong> Gnosticism opposes oppressive authority, while capitalism relies on authority structures to maintain control.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
    <p>The comparison between Gnosticism and capitalism is provocative but incomplete. While both involve detachment from the material world and promises of transcendence, their goals and mechanisms differ fundamentally:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gnosticism:</strong> Seeks liberation and enlightenment through spiritual transformation.</li>
        <li><strong>Capitalism:</strong> Commodifies transcendence, creating illusions that sustain systems of exploitation and alienation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bey’s critique highlights capitalism’s spiritual and psychological dimensions but risks oversimplifying Gnosticism’s philosophical and theological depth.</p>
</li>
        <li><strong>Global Hegemony and the State</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>State as Enforcer of Capital:</strong> Bey argues that global capitalism has subsumed the state, which now serves as a mercenary enforcing capital’s interests.</li>
                <li><strong>Commodification of Diversity:</strong> He critiques multiculturalism as a means to commodify difference while maintaining capitalist monoculture and systemic oppression.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Immediatism and Everyday Resistance</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Creative Action as Revolution:</strong> Bey emphasizes the revolutionary potential of daily creative acts and the reclamation of private spaces free from commodification.</li>
                <li><strong>Artists as Agents of Change:</strong> Creativity outside traditional markets is politically significant, providing resistance to capitalist structures.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Media Critique and Invisibility</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rejection of the Spectacle:</strong> He prefers invisibility over media visibility, rejecting the spectacle of modern media that only recognizes commodifiable content.</li>
                <li><strong>Marginalization of Intellectual Radicalism:</strong> Bey contrasts Europe’s intellectual traditions with the United States, where radical ideas are marginalized in public discourse.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>The Body as a Site of Resistance</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reintegration of Body and Spirit:</strong> Bey introduces the concept of a “psychic martial art,” emphasizing bodily awareness as resistance against the degradation and commodification of the body.</li>
                <li><strong>Zen and Material Awareness:</strong> Drawing from Zen philosophy, Bey highlights the “ordinary body” as a source of spiritual and revolutionary potential.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Temporary Autonomous Zones (T.A.Z.)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physicality of Autonomy:</strong> Bey emphasizes that true autonomy requires physical presence and cannot be sustained solely in cyberspace.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration of Realms:</strong> Autonomy must encompass physical, spiritual, and social dimensions to be effective.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Key Discussions</h3>
    <p>
        Bey critiques capitalism, the state, and the Spectacle while emphasizing the importance of immediatist practices, T.A.Z., and bodily awareness in resisting alienation and commodification. His philosophy challenges individuals to reclaim autonomy through creativity, difference, and direct communication.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Hakim Bey’s anarchist philosophy presents a compelling critique of capitalism and the state while offering a vision of resistance rooted in autonomy, creativity, and the integration of physical and spiritual realms. His insights inspire efforts toward holistic resistance and envisioning alternative futures grounded in reciprocity and freedom.
