**The Wheel of Fortune** is the tenth card in the Major Arcana of the Tarot, representing the cycles of life, fate, and destiny. This card embodies the concept of constant change, the rise and fall of fortunes, and the inevitable turning of the wheel that governs all aspects of existence. It signifies that life is in a state of perpetual motion, where one’s circumstances can change unexpectedly—sometimes for better, sometimes for worse.

### Symbolism and Imagery

The Wheel of Fortune card is rich in symbolism, with each element contributing to its themes of fate, change, and the cyclical nature of life. The card typically features a large, central wheel, often surrounded by various mystical and mythological figures.

- **The Wheel**: The central image of the card is a large wheel, often inscribed with various symbols and letters. The wheel itself is a powerful symbol of the cyclical nature of life, representing the endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, as well as the ongoing cycles of fortune and misfortune. It reminds us that life is a series of ups and downs, and that change is the only constant. The Wheel’s continuous motion signifies that no state—whether of joy or sorrow—will last forever.

- **Tetragrammaton (YHVH)**: Often, the wheel is inscribed with the Hebrew letters Yod, Heh, Vav, and Heh, which together form the Tetragrammaton, the name of God in the Hebrew tradition. This inclusion emphasizes the divine influence and the idea that the forces of fate and destiny are ultimately governed by a higher power. It suggests that while the wheel turns according to its own laws, there is a greater cosmic order at play.

- **The Letters TARO or ROTA**: In addition to the Tetragrammaton, the wheel may also bear the letters T, A, R, and O, which can be read as "TARO" (a reference to Tarot) or "ROTA" (Latin for "wheel"). This reinforces the idea of the card’s connection to the Tarot itself, which is a tool for understanding the cycles of life. The word "ROTA" also emphasizes the concept of rotation and the inevitable turning of the wheel, while "TARO" hints at the idea of esoteric wisdom and the hidden knowledge within the Tarot.

- **The Sphinx**: Atop the wheel often sits a sphinx, representing wisdom and the enigmatic nature of fate. The sphinx is a guardian of mystery, symbolizing the riddle of life and the unknown forces that influence our destiny. Its presence on the Wheel of Fortune card reminds us that while we may not fully understand the workings of fate, there is a deeper wisdom guiding the changes in our lives.

- **The Serpent**: Descending on one side of the wheel is a serpent, representing the force of life and the material world. The serpent is often associated with the god Typhon, a symbol of chaos and destruction. Its downward movement signifies the descent into the material realm, the physical and earthly aspects of life, and the inevitable decline that follows the peak of fortune. The serpent’s presence emphasizes that the cycles of life include both creation and destruction, growth and decay.

- **Anubis**: On the other side of the wheel, often ascending, is the figure of Anubis, the Egyptian god of the dead and the afterlife. Anubis represents regeneration and the transition from one phase of life to another. His ascent on the wheel signifies the upward movement of the soul, the journey toward spiritual enlightenment, and the positive changes that can follow periods of difficulty. Anubis’s role as a guide through the underworld also suggests that even in times of darkness, there is the potential for growth and renewal.

- **The Four Evangelists**: In the corners of the card, often depicted in the clouds, are the symbols of the four evangelists—an angel, an eagle, a lion, and a bull. These figures represent the four fixed signs of the zodiac: Aquarius (the angel), Scorpio (the eagle), Leo (the lion), and Taurus (the bull). They also correspond to the four elements—air, water, fire, and earth—and the four cardinal directions. The presence of the evangelists emphasizes the stability and order within the cycles of change, suggesting that while life is constantly in motion, it is governed by a higher, unchanging order. The evangelists are often depicted reading books, symbolizing knowledge and the recording of divine wisdom.

- **The Clouds and Sky**: The wheel is often depicted floating in the sky, surrounded by clouds. This imagery reinforces the idea that the forces represented by the wheel are above the mundane world and are part of the higher, spiritual realms. The clouds suggest that these forces are somewhat hidden or mysterious, not easily understood by the human mind.

The card encourages the querent to embrace change, to be adaptable, and to recognize that nothing stays the same forever. It reminds the querent that just as the wheel turns, their situation will also shift, and that they should be prepared for new opportunities or challenges.

3. **Karma and the Law of Cause and Effect**:

4. **Luck and Fortune**:
   - The Wheel of Fortune is often seen as a card of luck, indicating that the querent’s fortunes may be about to change. This change can be either fortunate or unfortunate, depending on the surrounding cards and the querent’s situation. The card suggests that the querent should be open to the opportunities that arise, as they may bring unexpected benefits. However, it also warns that just as luck can change for the better, it can also change for the worse, and that the querent should be mindful of how they handle their current situation.

5. **Acceptance and Surrender**:
   - The Wheel of Fortune encourages the querent to accept the cycles of life and to surrender to the flow of events. It teaches that there are times when it is necessary to relinquish control and to trust that the universe has a plan. The card suggests that the querent should not resist change but should instead adapt to it and make the best of whatever situation they find themselves in.

The card encourages the querent to trust in the timing of the universe, to be patient, and to have faith that everything will work out in the end. The Wheel of Fortune teaches that even in times of uncertainty, there is a greater order at play, and that the querent’s life is part of a larger, interconnected whole.

### The Wheel of Fortune in Different Contexts

- **In Career**: In a career reading, the Wheel of Fortune suggests that the querent may be entering a period of change or transition in their professional life. This could involve a new job opportunity, a promotion, or a shift in responsibilities. The card encourages the querent to be open to these changes and to recognize that they may bring new opportunities for growth and success. It also suggests that the querent should be mindful of the cyclical nature of their career and to be prepared for both ups and downs.

- **In Relationships**: In relationship readings, the Wheel of Fortune can indicate a turning point in a relationship, where circumstances are shifting, and the dynamics are changing. This could involve a new phase of the relationship, such as moving in together, getting engaged, or facing challenges that test the relationship. The card encourages the querent to embrace these changes and to trust that they are part of the natural evolution of the relationship. The Wheel of Fortune also suggests that relationships, like all aspects of life, go through cycles, and that it is important to adapt to these changes.

- **In Personal Development**: The Wheel of Fortune is a powerful symbol of personal growth and transformation. It suggests that the  querent is on a journey of self-discovery and that they are entering a new phase of their spiritual or personal development.

The Wheel of Fortune teaches that personal development is an ongoing process, and that by embracing change, the querent can continue to evolve and expand their understanding of themselves and the world.

### Reversed Wheel of Fortune

When the Wheel of Fortune appears reversed, its themes of change, fate, and cycles may take on a more challenging or obstructed quality.

- **Resisting Change**: The reversed Wheel of Fortune may indicate that the querent is resisting change or struggling to adapt to new circumstances. They may be holding on to the past or trying to maintain control in a situation that is naturally evolving. The card suggests that the querent needs to let go of their resistance and allow the changes to unfold, trusting that they are part of a larger plan.

- **Bad Luck or Misfortune**: Reversed, the Wheel of Fortune can indicate a period of bad luck or misfortune, where things seem to be going wrong. The querent may feel as though they are caught in a downward spiral, with one setback after another. The card encourages the querent to stay resilient and to remember that just as the wheel turns downwards, it will eventually turn upwards again. This is a time to stay grounded and to focus on what can be controlled.

- **Feeling Stuck**: The reversed Wheel of Fortune can also suggest that the querent feels stuck or trapped in a cycle that they cannot break free from. They may be experiencing a sense of stagnation or frustration, where progress seems impossible. The card suggests that the querent needs to take a step back, reassess their situation, and consider whether there are any changes they can make to move forward. It may also indicate that the querent needs to be patient and wait for the right timing.

- **Learning from Mistakes**: The reversed Wheel of Fortune encourages the querent to reflect on the lessons learned from past mistakes and to avoid repeating them. The card suggests that the querent may be facing the consequences of previous actions and that this is an opportunity to correct course and make better decisions in the future.

### Conclusion

9. The Wheel of Fortune (X)

	•	Sacred Geometry: The Flower of Life and Tetractys
	•	Description: The Flower of Life, with its infinite connections, and the Tetractys, a triangular figure that represents the numerical and mystical relationships between numbers, can be incorporated into “The Wheel of Fortune.” The Wheel itself could be surrounded by the Flower of Life, symbolizing the interconnectedness of all events and the cycles of life. The Tetractys, with its deep mathematical and philosophical significance, could be depicted as part of the central hub of the wheel, indicating the underlying order and balance within the chaos of change and fate.

Here is the Tarot card image for "10 The Wheel of Fortune" inspired by sacred geometry. The design features the Flower of Life and Tetractys on the central wheel, symbolizing the cycles of life, fate, and the interconnectedness of all things. The dynamic colors and geometric patterns emphasize the themes of change, cycles, and the cosmic nature of destiny.

Fortune Upright Meaning
The central theme of The Wheel of Fortune card is cyclical change. The wheel keeps on rolling, churning events in a ceaseless progression of ups and downs, either way freeing us from the past. No one can escape its cyclical action, which can feel somewhat terrifying -- no matter whether we are rising or falling. When one is balanced on top of the wheel, there is a moment of crystal clarity. However, the only part of the wheel that's actually not going up and down is the hub, which represents your eternal self.
Every one of us will occupy all the points on the wheel at one point or another. The cycle of the wheel is its lesson -- and we can learn to take comfort in it. If you don't like the look of things right now, just wait -- things will change. Of course, if you do like the look of things right now, enjoy it while it lasts, because that will change too!
Fortune Reversed Meaning
When the Wheel of Fortune card is reversed, it suggests that you may have dropped from the heights and have been sent back to the beginning -- to either start over or reframe your plan.
This may feel as if you have hit bottom, but think of it as a chance to renew yourself and chart a path that will help you rise from the ashes. You will be a more compassionate and wise ally when the next person takes a nosedive. In the future, you might want to be a little more modest in your aspirations.
Fortune Advice Position
The Wheel of Fortune advises you follow the flow of events. Physical moves, spiritual awakenings, or dramatically changing social patterns could arise now. Accept these transformations.
This is a safe place for you to be. You are watched over and protected as you go round and round the wheel. You will learn a lot. You will also learn it quickly, and what you absorb will benefit you for a long time to come.
Fortune Love Position
The Wheel of Fortune in this position indicates that your mind or your heart just won't keep still. It keeps churning up new developments or issues that you thought were resolved between you and your next potential partner. This is the nature of The Wheel of Fortune that never ceases to turn.
You probably feel like you want to get off life's Ferris wheel once in a while, but there is only one good way to do that -- take refuge in the hub, the center from which all the motion is emanating. Much as you might like to, there is no way to stay on top all the time. Your ultimate challenge is to learn to peak and drop without resisting the process, including all its ups and downs.
Fortune Career Position
When the Wheel of Fortune is in this position, your circumstances surrounding work are fluctuating. Don't take it personally because you may be in the presence of a force no mortal can control. The immediate future of your current job appears uncertain. No one can blame you for feeling a bit overwhelmed or confused. Try not to dwell on that.
Think of this great Wheel as being like a cosmic washing machine. If you can put up with the churning, the rinse cycle and the final spin, the end result will see you refreshed, like new. The energy of this card certainly can feel like you are going in circles. But it's more like a spiral staircase, and you will end up exactly where you wanted to go. (Even so, it can be a challenge to keep your composure during the turning!)
Wait and watch, and as you do so, try to absorb and understand the changes you are going through. You won't get lost if you follow the flow.

Fortune in a Yes or No Card Reading
The Wheel of Fortune is a card of patterns and cycles. If you're looking for simple Yes or No guidance and receive The Wheel of
 Fortune, the answer is NO. Wait for now -- elements are still in motion.

The Wheel of Fortune Tarot Card Description
The Wheel of Fortune is one of the most highly symbolic cards in the deck, filled with signs that each have its own meaning. At the center of the card, lies a giant wheel, covered in esoteric symbols. There are different creatures that surround the wheel; the angel, the eagle, the bull and the lion. They are related to four fixed signs in the zodiac - leo, taurus, scorpio and aquarius. These four animals are also representatives for the four evangelists in Christian traditions, which is perhaps the reason that they are all adorned with wings.
The books that each of the creatures hold represents the Torah which communicates wisdom and self-understanding. The snake indicates the act of descending into material world. On the wheel itself, rides a sphinx that sits at the top, and what appears to be either a devil, or Anubis himself arising at the bottom. These two Egyptian figures are representative of both the wisdom of the gods and kings (in the case of the sphinx) and the underworld (Anubis). They are rotating forever, in a cycle, and suggests that as one comes up, the other goes down.

Upright Wheel of Fortune Meaning
The Wheel of Fortune turns evermore, seemingly to communicate that life is made up of both good and bad times, and that the cycle is one that we cannot control. It is something that is subjected to both kings and workers, and that nobody on earth can avoid what is fated. When you have good moments in your life, make sure that you enjoy to the fullest, for what comes up must always go down. The same is true in reverse - when you are in a bad situation, things will eventually become better again. 
The same forces that govern the changing of the seasons, or the rising and setting of the sun is also the master of luck and the fate of individuals.
Greater forces that are outside of human control are at work here. The same forces that govern the changing of the seasons, or the rising and setting of the sun is also the master of luck and the fate of individuals. Where it lands is as random as chance - you may find yourself at either the top or bottom, but remember that no matter what the outcome it may not last for very long, for the wheel always turns.

Upright Love Meaning

relationship changes, navigating change with partner, making adjustments

Upright Wheel of Fortune Tarot Love Meaning
Life is full of unexpected changes, and love is no different. The Wheel of Fortune tarot love meaning can signal great changes in your relationship, perhaps one that you didn’t see coming. These aren’t necessarily bad things, but adjustments may have to be made. The commitment you have with your partner may be tested now, and both of you may have to put in some effort or sacrifice in order to remain together. Should you choose to make the choice, your partnership may become closer than ever as the two of you learn to navigate the ups and downs of life together as a team. It is important to understand that whether the changes are positive or negative, they are not forever, for the wheel is always turning.

Upright Career Meaning

luck in career, opportunities present, adapting to changes at work

Career Meaning - Upright Wheel of Fortune
Big changes may be coming when it comes to your career. Should you be considering making a switch in your career path or your position, now may be a good time to make those moves. Try and be more aware of the opportunities that are in your environment for you now, and say yes when they arise. Sometimes, the changes that are coming your way may be difficult and challenging, but these can actually be blessings for you to develop your skills and get you ready for future growth. Embrace these changes, and make yourself adaptable. Going alongside the flow of these changes is likely to bring you success.  

Upright Finances Meaning

changes in material situation, being flexible with finances

Finances Meaning - Upright Wheel of Fortune
When it comes to your finances, the Wheel of Fortune also suggests change, so be ready to adapt to whatever comes your way. If you’ve been financially comfortable, make sure you keep putting a certain amount away to get you through hard times. Should you be dealing with material hardship, be assured that this not meant to last forever. Keep your eyes open to any opportunities that open up to you. 

Reversed Wheel of Fortune Meaning
When the wheel is reversed, it means that luck has not been on your side and misfortunes have been following you. When it's associated with this card, you must understand that these are due to external influences that you cannot control. Like the wheel, our luck and our fate is always in motion, and sometimes we are on the bottom. Be assured that the wheel will turn again, and you will be okay again soon.  What you shouldn't do however, is cling to the illusion of control. Perhaps in this turn of the wheel, the lesson is to learn to let go and release. There are things that cannot be moved by human will and action alone. When we do not let go, it can bring only more suffering, for you may blame yourself for actions that could not have altered the situation. When we learn to accept, we also learn to forgive ourselves. We learn to move on, and move forward - and eventually, we learn that this feeling of acceptance can push the wheel again forward, and move it towards a new cycle.

Reversed Love Meaning

external events affecting relationship, love life out of control

Reversed Wheel of Fortune Tarot Love Meaning
There are times, that no matter how much we try, the world will not bend to one’s will. Life may have thrown an unexpected wrench into your plans, and there is not much that you can do other than remember that this too will pass. It is likely that some external factor may be affecting your relationships right now, and you may have to adapt to it, and accept it with patience rather than attempting to control this situation. Other aspects of your life may be demanding right now, as your romantic life may have to take a pause. If you are in a partnership, try and tackle these problems as a team and communicate openly.

Reversed Career Meaning

failure to adapt at work, forcing past solutions

Career Meaning - Reversed Wheel of Fortune
Are things in your work life changing quickly? You may find it difficult to keep up at the moment. All these surprises are things that may feel disruptive to your plans. You may keep trying to make a past solution work, instead of flowing alongside the events that are unfolding right now. It is important to not cling to the past or your expectations, but instead remain flexible and ready to change your plans. Are your responsibilities changing at work? Does your project’s requirements keep updating? This can be very frustrating, but instead of fighting it, try and figure out your own process to deal with it. It’s important to make sure you find your center. 

Reversed Finances Meaning

unexpected financial changes, preparation

Finances Meaning - Reversed Wheel of Fortune
Be wary of taking risks when it comes to your finances, as this card can suggest unexpected and unwelcome events. It may be wise right now to build a small emergency fund; even if nothing does happen, having something stowed away can help relieve anxiety about what comes next. The world is constantly changing, make sure you’re ready for it

The Wheel of Fortune, the tenth card in the Tarot's Major Arcana, symbolizes cycles, fate, karma, and the constant change inherent in life. It represents the turning of the wheel of life, where ups and downs are part of the journey, and where forces beyond human control often guide the outcome. When examined through the lens of Sacred Geometry, The Wheel of Fortune’s symbolism is intricately connected to the principles of cycles, patterns, cosmic order, and the interplay of forces. Here’s a detailed exploration of how Sacred Geometry applies to The Wheel of Fortune:

### 1. **The Number 10 (Symbol of Completion, Cycles, and Renewal)**
   - **The Decagon (Ten-Sided Polygon)**: The number 10 is associated with the decagon, a ten-sided polygon that represents completion, the end of a cycle, and the beginning of a new one. The decagon’s structure symbolizes the totality of experience and the idea that every end is also a new beginning. In the context of The Wheel of Fortune, the decagon reflects the cyclical nature of life, where each phase of the journey leads to the next, and where every turn of the wheel brings both closure and the potential for renewal. The decagon's symmetry and balance highlight the idea that all experiences—whether perceived as positive or negative—are part of a larger, harmonious pattern.
   - **10 as a Symbol of Cosmic Order**: In numerology, the number 10 symbolizes the completion of a cycle and the return to unity, often seen as a return to the number 1 (since 10 reduces to 1 in numerology: 1+0=1). The Wheel of Fortune embodies this concept, where the turning of the wheel brings all things back to their origin, reflecting the cyclical nature of existence and the cosmic order that governs it. The number 10’s association with both completion and new beginnings emphasizes the idea that life is a continuous cycle of endings and beginnings, guided by the forces of fate and destiny.

### 2. **The Circle (Symbol of Cycles, Eternity, and Wholeness)**
   - **The Wheel as a Circle**: The central symbol of The Wheel of Fortune is, of course, the wheel itself, which is a perfect representation of the circle in Sacred Geometry. The circle is a symbol of eternity, unity, and wholeness, reflecting the unending cycle of life, death, and rebirth. The Wheel of Fortune, as a circle, symbolizes the continuous movement of life’s cycles, where each turn represents a phase in the journey, and where all things are interconnected in a seamless flow. The circle’s unbroken line represents the eternal nature of these cycles, where every point on the wheel is both a beginning and an end.
   - **The Ouroboros (Self-Perpetuating Cycle)**: In some depictions of The Wheel of Fortune, the ouroboros—a serpent eating its own tail—encircles the wheel. The ouroboros is a powerful symbol of the eternal cycle of creation, destruction, and renewal. It represents the self-perpetuating nature of the wheel, where every turn leads to the next, and where all things are part of a continuous cycle of transformation. The ouroboros emphasizes the idea that the forces driving The Wheel of Fortune are not external but intrinsic to the nature of the universe, where everything is interconnected and part of a greater whole.

### 3. **The Spiral (Symbol of Evolution, Growth, and Cyclical Progress)**
   - **The Wheel as a Spiral of Growth**: The spiral, a fundamental symbol in Sacred Geometry, represents evolution, growth, and the idea of cyclical progress. While the wheel is often depicted as a simple circle, it can also be understood as a spiral, where each turn represents a deeper level of understanding and experience. The Wheel of Fortune’s continuous turning reflects the idea that life’s journey is not just a repetitive cycle but one of growth and evolution, where each turn of the wheel brings new insights, challenges, and opportunities for growth. The spiral’s connection to both cycles and forward movement emphasizes the idea that even as we return to familiar patterns, we do so with a greater awareness and understanding.
   - **Dynamic Balance and Adaptation**: The spiral also represents dynamic balance, where the forces of change are not resisted but embraced as part of the natural flow of life. The Wheel of Fortune’s turning symbolizes the need for adaptability and resilience, where the individual must learn to navigate the ups and downs of life with grace and flexibility. The spiral’s continuous movement reflects the idea that life is always in flux, and that true wisdom comes from understanding and aligning with these natural cycles.

### 4. **The Tetractys (Symbol of Cosmic Order and the Decade)**
   - **The Tetractys and the Number 10**: The Tetractys is a triangular figure composed of ten points arranged in four rows (1, 2, 3, and 4 points per row), symbolizing the organization of the cosmos and the harmonious structure of the universe. The Tetractys represents the number 10 and is deeply connected to the idea of completion and the integration of all levels of existence—spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical. In the context of The Wheel of Fortune, the Tetractys symbolizes the underlying order that governs the turning of the wheel, where each phase of life is part of a greater cosmic pattern. The Tetractys’ structure reflects the idea that all aspects of existence are interconnected and that the cycles of life are guided by a higher order.
   - **Manifestation of Divine Order**: The Tetractys also represents the manifestation of divine order in the material world, where the forces of fate and destiny are seen as expressions of a greater cosmic plan. The Wheel of Fortune’s turning reflects this divine order, where each turn is guided by forces beyond human control, yet perfectly aligned with the universal laws that govern all things. The Tetractys’ symbolism of harmony and balance emphasizes the idea that even the most unpredictable events are part of a larger, harmonious pattern that ultimately leads to growth and evolution.

### 5. **The Triangle (Symbol of Change, Integration, and Ascension)**
   - **The Triangle as a Catalyst for Change**: The triangle, with its three sides, represents the principle of change, integration, and ascension. In the context of The Wheel of Fortune, the triangle symbolizes the transformative power of change, where each turn of the wheel brings a shift in circumstances and perspectives. The triangle’s connection to fire, a symbol of transformation and dynamic energy, reflects the idea that change is a necessary and powerful force in the journey of life. The Wheel of Fortune’s turning is a catalyst for growth, where each phase of the cycle offers new opportunities for integration and self-discovery.
   - **Integration of Body, Mind, and Spirit**: The triangle also represents the integration of body, mind, and spirit, which is essential for navigating the cycles of life with balance and harmony. The Wheel of Fortune’s turning symbolizes the need to harmonize these three aspects of the self, where each phase of the journey requires a different focus and approach. The triangle’s stability reflects the idea that true strength and resilience come from maintaining this balance, even as the wheel turns and circumstances change.

### 6. **The Hexagon and Hexagram (Symbol of Harmony, Stability, and Interconnected Forces)**
   - **Hexagon as a Symbol of Balance and Structure**: The hexagon, with its six sides, represents harmony, stability, and the efficient structuring of energy. In the context of The Wheel of Fortune, the hexagon symbolizes the underlying structure that governs the cycles of life, where each turn of the wheel is part of a balanced and harmonious pattern. The hexagon’s connection to the natural world, such as in the structure of honeycombs, reflects the idea that life’s cycles are not random but guided by an inherent order and balance. The Wheel of Fortune’s turning is a reflection of this natural order, where each phase of the journey is perfectly aligned with the cosmic patterns that govern all things.
   - **Hexagram (Star of David)**: The hexagram, or Star of David, is formed by the interlocking of two equilateral triangles, symbolizing the union of opposites—masculine and feminine, spirit and matter, light and dark. The Wheel of Fortune embodies this union, where the turning of the wheel represents the dynamic interplay of these opposing forces. The hexagram’s perfect symmetry reflects the idea that the cycles of life are guided by a balance of forces, where each turn of the wheel brings both challenges and opportunities for growth. The Wheel of Fortune’s turning is a dance of these forces, where the individual must learn to navigate the ups and downs with grace and balance.

### 7. **The Flower of Life (Symbol of Interconnection and Cosmic Patterns)**
   - **The Wheel as Part of the Flower of Life**: The Flower of Life, a complex geometric pattern composed of overlapping circles, symbolizes the interconnectedness of all life and the underlying structure of the universe. The Wheel of Fortune can be seen as a part of this larger pattern, where each turn of the wheel is connected to the greater cycles and rhythms of existence. The Flower of Life’s intricate design reflects the complexity and depth of the forces that drive The Wheel of Fortune, where each phase of the journey is part of a larger, interconnected web of experiences and relationships. The Wheel of Fortune’s turning is a reflection of these cosmic patterns, where every event is connected to a greater whole.
   - **Alignment with Cosmic Order**: The Flower of Life’s perfect symmetry and harmony reflect the idea that The Wheel of Fortune’s cycles are aligned with the cosmic order. The turning of the wheel is not random but guided by the universal laws that govern all things, where each phase of the journey is perfectly timed  and aligned with the greater patterns of existence. The Flower of Life’s symbolism of interconnection emphasizes the idea that all things are connected, and that the cycles of life are part of a larger, harmonious design that ultimately leads to growth and evolution.

### 8. **The Torus (Symbol of Infinite Cycles and Flow)**
   - **The Wheel as a Torus**: The torus is a geometric shape that represents the concept of flow, energy, and infinite cycles. It is often depicted as a donut-shaped figure, where energy moves continuously in a self-sustaining loop. The Wheel of Fortune can be seen as a metaphorical torus, where the cycles of life are continuous and self-perpetuating, with each turn of the wheel representing a new phase in the journey. The torus’s shape reflects the idea that life’s energy is constantly moving and evolving, where each experience is connected to the next in an endless flow of transformation and renewal.
   - **Infinite Potential and Balance**: The torus also symbolizes infinite potential and the balance of energies within the universe. The Wheel of Fortune’s turning reflects this infinite potential, where each phase of the journey offers new possibilities for growth and expansion. The torus’s dynamic balance emphasizes the idea that life is always in motion, and that true wisdom comes from understanding and aligning with the natural flow of these cycles. The Wheel of Fortune’s turning is a reflection of this balance, where the individual must learn to navigate the cycles of life with awareness and adaptability.

### 9. **The Mandala (Symbol of Wholeness, Unity, and the Cosmic Wheel)**
   - **The Wheel as a Mandala**: The mandala, a complex geometric design that represents the universe and cosmic order, is a powerful symbol of wholeness, unity, and the cycles of existence. The Wheel of Fortune can be seen as a mandala, where each turn of the wheel is part of a larger, harmonious pattern that reflects the interconnectedness of all things. The mandala’s circular shape emphasizes the idea that life is a continuous cycle of creation, destruction, and renewal, where each phase of the journey is part of a greater whole. The Wheel of Fortune’s turning is a reflection of this cosmic order, where the cycles of life are guided by the universal laws that govern the universe.
   - **Centering and Alignment**: The mandala’s central point represents the core of the self, where all aspects of the individual are unified and brought into balance. The Wheel of Fortune’s turning reflects the idea that life’s cycles are opportunities for centering and alignment, where each phase of the journey offers a chance to reconnect with the inner self and achieve a deeper understanding of the universe. The mandala’s intricate patterns reflect the complexity and depth of the forces that drive The Wheel of Fortune, where each turn of the wheel is part of a larger, harmonious design that ultimately leads to growth and self-realization.

### Conclusion:
The Wheel of Fortune, when viewed through the lens of Sacred Geometry, is revealed as a profound symbol of cycles, cosmic order, and the interplay of forces that govern the universe. The card is deeply connected to geometric principles such as the decagon, circle, spiral, Tetractys, triangle, hexagon, Flower of Life, torus, and mandala. Each of these symbols reflects aspects of The Wheel of Fortune’s teachings—how life’s cycles are part of a larger cosmic pattern, how change is a necessary and powerful force in the journey of life, and how the individual must learn to navigate these cycles with balance, awareness, and adaptability. Sacred Geometry reveals The Wheel of Fortune not just as a symbol of fate and destiny, but as a reflection of the underlying patterns and structures that govern all of existence, where each turn of the wheel is an opportunity for growth, renewal, and alignment with the greater cosmic order.
