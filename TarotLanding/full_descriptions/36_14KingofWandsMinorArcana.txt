This suit, most often called "Wands" and sometimes called "Rods" or "Staves," represents initiative, ambition, drive and desire. This is the suit of enterprise and risk-taking.
Traditionally representing the energy of a dynamic King, this card represents the classic conquering hero. He's a charismatic leader, entrepreneurial and ambitious, always creating new adventures. He does this because he doesn't like to stay home or to have to "mind the store" -- he gets to feeling restless and bored with the predictable. If you need a crusader, or someone to take on a big challenge, he's your man. He needs a big assignment, and would rather lead than follow.
It could be said that he has a bit of an ego, as evidenced in his enjoyment of flattery and praise. A bit of a performer, he overachieves in situations where it will be noticed, but in private he wants to be served and adored like the head lion of a pride. A benevolent dictator, he makes life wonderful for those he loves and just the opposite for those who displease him.

You may be thinking you are doing the right thing, pushing others to be their best self, but even the best intentions can be soured with a forceful, pressuring hand. Everyone has their own way of learning, and you may be better off letting your partners explore their own solutions to their own problems, instead of coercing them to do things your way.

If you have a goal or career in mind, things might not be going well in your career because you lack the confidence. It is important to trust your own instincts over the advice of others sometimes. Everyone views the world through their own lens; remember that someone else’s bias might cloud their vision of what you need. Trust yourself in your career.

Seek more/different employment. Whatever makes sense to you in your position is likely best. It is easier to wait and hope money falls into your lap but rarely does it happen. Instead, try to take productive and defined steps towards your goals. You have the ability to realize your financial dreams. You just need to work for them.
