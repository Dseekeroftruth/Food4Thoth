3.	Three of Wands
	•	Sacred Geometry: Triangle (Expanding)
	•	Description: The Three of Wands symbolizes expansion and foresight. An expanding triangle, representing growth and the progression of ideas, could be depicted in the background, with each point of the triangle extending outward. This geometric form emphasizes the movement from a strong foundation towards broader horizons and the anticipation of what’s to come.

Here is the Tarot card image for the "Three of Wands" inspired by sacred geometry. The design incorporates an expanding triangle and geometric patterns, symbolizing growth, foresight, and new opportunities, seamlessly integrated into the traditional Tarot imagery.

Three of Wands Upright Meaning
This suit, most often called "Wands" and sometimes called "Rods" or "Staves," represents initiative, ambition, drive and desire. This is the suit of enterprise and risk-taking.
A Three in this suit symbolizes an inner balance that allows you to feel more optimistic about new endeavors you are committed to, or want to commit to. In the illustrated Tarots, the human character is standing on his balcony, watching ships leave the harbor, loaded with his goods for far-off ports, dreaming of the fortune he will reap if all goes well. Summon the optimism within you.
This energy must be patient and trusting, because he or she will have to wait some time to find out how the ships have fared. Meanwhile, a lot of resources are tied up until they return with the bounty. Only those truly confident in their ideas and abilities would undertake such a risk. This card represents the energy a person needs to take on great adventures and accomplish noble (and remunerative) deeds.
A detail that sometimes appears in the more esoteric Tarots is a winged wand with two snakes twining around it, called the Caduceus, which is Mercury's wand. This is an ancient symbol of the healer or shaman, one who can travel between the worlds to rescue souls from death or possession. Perhaps the feeling of empowerment this card represents points to the internal mechanisms of self-healing. Perhaps it refers to the courage it takes to be an entrepreneur or an inventor, which is in itself a magical process -- bringing not only opportunity for success, but also an awakening to higher potentials.

The Three of Wands, a card in the Tarot’s Minor Arcana, represents progress, expansion, and the manifestation of plans into action. It is often depicted as a figure standing on a hill, looking out over the ocean where ships sail, symbolizing the successful implementation of ideas and the anticipation of future results. When viewed through the lens of Sacred Geometry, the symbolism of the Three of Wands reveals deep connections to growth, balance, and the geometric principles that underlie the expansion of vision into reality. Here’s an in-depth exploration of how Sacred Geometry applies to the Three of Wands:

### 1. **The Number 3 (Symbol of Harmony, Expansion, and the Trinity)**
   - **Trinity and Expansion**: In Sacred Geometry, the number 3 represents the Trinity, a fundamental principle that signifies the synthesis of opposites to create a harmonious whole. In the Three of Wands, this number reflects the harmonious integration of planning (represented by the Two of Wands) and action. The Three of Wands symbolizes the expansion that comes from this integration, where ideas begin to manifest into tangible outcomes. The number 3 also represents the stages of development: initiation, growth, and completion. Here, the card signifies the growth phase, where the initial spark of inspiration (Ace of Wands) and the planning (Two of Wands) start to yield visible results.
   - **Balance and Growth**: The number 3 also symbolizes balance and equilibrium, crucial for the successful expansion of any venture. In the Three of Wands, this balance is reflected in the figure’s steady gaze over the horizon, symbolizing the anticipation of balanced and measured growth. The card suggests that true progress comes from maintaining harmony between vision, planning, and action.

### 2. **The Triangle (Symbol of Aspiration, Stability, and Creation)**
   - **The Triangle as a Structure of Growth**: The triangle, particularly the upward-pointing triangle, is a symbol of aspiration, spiritual growth, and stability. In the Three of Wands, the triangle represents the stable foundation necessary for expansion. The three points of the triangle can symbolize the integration of body, mind, and spirit in the pursuit of a goal, suggesting that successful expansion requires all aspects of the self to be aligned. The triangle’s upward direction also symbolizes the aspiration to reach new heights and expand one’s horizons.
   - **Creation and Manifestation**: The triangle is also a symbol of creation and the manifestation of ideas into reality. In the Three of Wands, this symbol reflects the idea that the initial planning and vision (seen in the Two of Wands) have now taken form and are beginning to manifest in the material world. The triangle’s symmetry emphasizes the importance of a solid and balanced approach to ensure that growth is sustainable and stable.

### 3. **The Line (Symbol of Direction, Focus, and Progression)**
   - **The Line of Progression**: The straight line in Sacred Geometry represents direction, focus, and the movement from one point to another. In the Three of Wands, the line symbolizes the forward momentum and progression of plans that have been set into motion. The figure’s gaze into the distance suggests a clear and focused direction, with the line representing the path from the present into the future. This forward movement is essential for expansion, where the initial steps taken are now leading to further development and opportunities.
   - **Path of Manifestation**: The line also symbolizes the path of manifestation, where the energy and intentions set in the earlier stages are now starting to yield results. In the Three of Wands, this symbol highlights the importance of staying focused and maintaining a clear direction to ensure that the expansion continues smoothly. The line represents the unfolding of plans into reality, with the figure’s position indicating that they are actively guiding this process.

### 4. **The Circle (Symbol of Unity, Wholeness, and Continuous Growth)**
   - **The Circle of Continuous Expansion**: The circle in Sacred Geometry represents unity, wholeness, and the cyclical nature of growth. In the Three of Wands, the circle can symbolize the continuous cycle of expansion, where each new success leads to further opportunities for growth. The figure’s view of the horizon can be seen as looking out over a world of endless possibilities, symbolized by the circular shape of the Earth. This circle emphasizes the idea that growth is not linear but occurs in cycles, with each phase of expansion leading to the next.
   - **Wholeness and Vision**: The circle also represents the wholeness of vision, where the figure’s plans and actions are part of a larger, unified strategy. In the Three of Wands, this symbol highlights the importance of maintaining a holistic view of one’s goals, ensuring that each step taken contributes to the overall vision. The circle’s symbolism emphasizes that true expansion comes from recognizing and embracing the interconnectedness of all aspects of the journey.

### 5. **The Vesica Piscis (Symbol of Creation, Union, and New Possibilities)**
   - **The Vesica Piscis as the Birth of New Opportunities**: The Vesica Piscis, formed by the intersection of two circles, represents the creation of new possibilities through the union of opposites. In the Three of Wands, this symbol reflects the intersection of past efforts and future opportunities, where the figure stands at the threshold of new possibilities. The Vesica Piscis emphasizes that the expansion represented by the Three of Wands is a creative process, where the synthesis of planning and action leads to the birth of new ventures and opportunities.
   - **Union of Vision and Action**: The Vesica Piscis also symbolizes the union of vision (inspired by the initial planning) and action (the steps taken to implement those plans). In the Three of Wands, this union is crucial for the successful expansion of one’s goals, where the creative energy of the Vesica Piscis is harnessed to manifest new realities. This symbol underscores the idea that true growth comes from the harmonious integration of intention and action.

### 6. **The Spiral (Symbol of Growth, Expansion, and Evolution)**
   - **The Spiral of Expansion**: The spiral is a powerful symbol in Sacred Geometry that represents growth, expansion, and the evolutionary process. In the context of the Three of Wands, the spiral symbolizes the ongoing expansion of the figure’s plans and the continuous evolution of their goals. The Three of Wands represents a phase in the journey where initial efforts are starting to expand outward, much like a spiral that grows and evolves as it moves. The spiral emphasizes that growth is not a straight line but a dynamic and evolving process.
   - **Evolution of Plans**: The spiral also represents the idea that plans and goals will continue to evolve and grow over time. In the Three of Wands, this symbol suggests that the figure’s journey is just beginning, with many more opportunities for expansion on the horizon. The spiral’s symbolism highlights the importance of being open to change and adaptation, where each new turn of the spiral brings fresh opportunities for growth.

### 7. **The Flower of Life (Symbol of Interconnectedness, Unity, and the Blueprint of Expansion)**
   - **The Flower of Life as the Blueprint for Expansion**: The Flower of Life, a complex geometric pattern composed of overlapping circles, symbolizes the interconnectedness of all life and the underlying blueprint for creation. In the Three of Wands, this symbol can be interpreted as the underlying structure that guides the figure’s expansion and growth. The Flower of Life represents the idea that all actions and outcomes are interconnected, with each decision contributing to the overall pattern of growth and expansion.
   - **Unity Through Expansion**: The Flower of Life also symbolizes unity, where the individual’s actions and goals are part of a greater, interconnected whole. In the Three of Wands, this unity is reflected in the idea that the figure’s expansion is not isolated but is part of a larger process of growth that extends beyond the individual to the entire cosmos. The Flower of Life’s intricate design reflects the complexity of expansion, where each step taken is part of a greater tapestry of life.

### 8. **The Hexagon (Symbol of Balance, Harmony, and Structured Growth)**
   - **Hexagon as a Symbol of Structured Expansion**: The hexagon, with its six sides, represents balance, harmony, and the efficient structuring of energy in Sacred Geometry. In the Three of Wands, the hexagon symbolizes the structured and balanced approach necessary for successful expansion. The figure’s contemplative stance suggests a measured and thoughtful approach to growth, where the hexagon’s symmetry emphasizes the importance of maintaining balance and harmony in the expansion process.
   - **Harmony in Growth**: The hexagon also represents the idea that true growth is harmonious and well-structured. In the Three of Wands, this symbol reflects the importance of building a strong and stable foundation for future expansion, where each step is carefully planned and executed. The hexagon’s symbolism highlights the importance of creating a balanced and harmonious environment for growth, ensuring that expansion is sustainable and enduring.

### 9. **The Mandala (Symbol of Wholeness, Cosmic Order, and Centered Growth)**
   - **The Mandala of Centered Expansion**: The mandala, a complex geometric design that represents the universe and cosmic order, is a symbol of wholeness, unity, and the centering of energy. In the Three of Wands, the mandala represents the idea that true expansion comes from a centered and balanced state of mind. The figure’s gaze over the horizon symbolizes the alignment of their goals with the cosmic order, where the expansion is in harmony with the larger patterns and rhythms of life.
   - **Wholeness Through Expansion**: The mandala’s circular shape emphasizes the idea that true growth and expansion come from recognizing and embracing the interconnectedness of all things, where the individual’s actions are in harmony with the greater whole. In the Three of Wands, this wholeness is achieved through careful planning and a balanced approach to growth, where the figure considers all aspects of their journey before taking action.

### 10. **The Torus (Symbol of Continuous Flow, Energy, and Dynamic Growth)**
   - **The Torus of Dynamic Expansion**: The torus is a geometric shape that represents the concept of flow, energy, and continuous cycles. In the Three of Wands, the torus symbolizes the dynamic nature of expansion, where the figure must continuously adapt and respond to changing circumstances as their plans unfold. The torus represents the idea that expansion is not a static process but one that involves continuous movement and evolution, with energy flowing in and out as new opportunities and challenges arise.
   - **Continuous Flow of Expansion**: The torus also represents the continuous flow of energy and growth, where the individual’s plans and goals are constantly evolving. In the Three of Wands, this means that the figure’s expansion is part of an ongoing process that will change and grow as new opportunities emerge.
