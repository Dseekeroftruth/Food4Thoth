# Quantum Walking Animation Preview

A sneak peek into the kinetic dreamscape of our upcoming side-scroller…

---

# Overview

This project is a live demo and test preview of character animation sequences designed for an in-development side-scrolling game currently being crafted by our creative team. Released both for fun and feedback, this sample showcases a quantum traveler making their way through shifting dimensional landscapes — each step a portal, every frame a shimmer of motion through time.

## “Animation as motion, motion as meditation.”

These walking sequences serve as an experimental foundation for a rich, immersive environment that will eventually include sound-reactive dynamics, interactive terrain, and metaphysical mechanics.

# Included Variants

1. Full Background Loop Variant
    - Seamless sprite animation of 9 illustrated frames.
		
    - Backgrounds cycle subtly with each loop iteration, creating an illusion of journeying through multiverses.
		
    - Designed for fullscreen canvas environments.
		
    - Triggered via postMessage from parent or controller applications.

2. Transparent Background Variant
    - Same character animation, but rendered against a transparent canvas.
		
    - Perfect for layering over other interfaces, apps, or experimental compositions.
		
    - Lightweight and adjustable — background-free for integration or projection.

# How It Works

### Sprite Animation

The animation simulates walking using a sprite sheet broken into separate frames (Untitled.png through Untitled9.png). Each frame is cycled via CSS or JavaScript to achieve smooth motion.

### Background Cycling

In the full version, backgrounds transition with each animation loop:
- BG2.webp
- BG4.webp
- BG9.webp
- BG10.webp

This gives the illusion of traversing shifting dimensions.

# Live Controls & Integration

The preview supports external control and theme toggling via window.postMessage:

window.postMessage({ triggerAnimation: true });
window.postMessage({ darkMode: true });

- triggerAnimation: Starts sprite animation.
- darkMode: Toggles dark mode styling (for transparent version).

---

# Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Keyframes + Responsive Design)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Optimized image preloading
- PostMessage API for cross-context control
