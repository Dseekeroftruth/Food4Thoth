Nine of Wands Upright Meaning
This suit, most often called "Wands" and sometimes called "Rods" or "Staves," represents initiative, ambition, drive and desire. This is the suit of enterprise and risk-taking.
The Nine of this suit usually indicates a need for rest; some time out to mend wounds and savor victories. Although it may be hard to do, this card would have you leave the field to fresher teammates for now. Release any attachment you may feel to being in a leadership role for now.
In the pictured Tarot decks, the protagonist is shown as too exhausted to be effective in defending his gains, yet resisting the suggestion to ask for help or step down. He or she hasn't had the chance to totally heal from past blows, and is still up there taking another beating. This is the fix that comes from making oneself irreplaceable. Fight off the maniacal thought that only you can save the day! Stop rejecting loved ones who want to help you.

Nine of Wands Reversed Meaning
Avoid a situation that seems like a losing battle. Seek new perspective. When the Nine of Wands is reversed, it is time to question your motives. Are you truly defending the high ground because of humanitarian motives? Or are you merely competing with others? If you truly don't belong at the forefront when all is said and done, you will not be seen as a hero for obstructing others.
Nine of Wands Advice Position
When the Nine of Wands is in this position, you have done everything you can to bring a situation to a successful conclusion. The full range of possibilities has been exhausted and all the creative energy that is available has already been put to use. This may be a great time to lay down your concerns and enjoy a rest. There is nothing more to bring to the mission unless you regenerate and restore the energy you have put into the cause.
While it is praiseworthy to give all you have for something or someone that means a lot to you, masochism and martyrdom are ill advised. Take a break. No one can fault you for it now.

Try to remember that exhaustion impairs the ability to make good decisions, giving negative forces an opportunity to gain an advantage. For the sake of yourself and your partner, take a break!
Nine of Wands Career Position
The Nine of Wands in this position suggests that work relationships may be calling for re-organization. If the current state of communication is stressful, it may damage the goodwill that had built up between the ranks. Everybody seems to be under duress, or at least that is the shared perception. Just because you think your boss, co-worker or customer is being grouchy and non-compassionate, there is no reason for you to become that way.
The situation would be best served if the defined leadership took a back seat for awhile, riding along as passengers and taking note of what others can do. Without more trust in the workers, those leaders will alienate the very ones they depend upon. Instead of one person being the hero/oppressor, let everybody share both the responsibilities and the rewards.
