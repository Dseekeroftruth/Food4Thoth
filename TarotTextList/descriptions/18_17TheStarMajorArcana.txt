**The Star** is the 17th card in the Major Arcana of the Tarot deck, and it is one of the most uplifting and hopeful cards in the Tarot. The Star symbolizes inspiration, renewal, hope, and a sense of purpose. It represents a period of calm and serenity following turmoil, offering a glimpse of peace and the possibility of new beginnings. The Star is often seen as a guiding light, providing clarity, encouragement, and reassurance that difficult times are giving way to brighter days.

### Symbolism and Imagery

The imagery of The Star is serene and filled with symbols that convey its themes of hope, renewal, and spiritual connection.

- **The Central Figure (The Water Bearer)**: The central figure on The Star card is usually a woman, often depicted as nude, representing purity and vulnerability. She is typically shown kneeling by a body of water, one foot on the land and one foot in the water. This posture symbolizes a connection between the physical and spiritual worlds, as well as the balance between the conscious and unconscious mind. The figure is often referred to as the Water Bearer, and she holds two pitchers, pouring water from both. One pitcher pours water into the pool, representing the nourishing and healing of the unconscious. The other pitcher pours water onto the land, often creating five streams, symbolizing the flow of consciousness into the material world and the nourishing of the five senses.

- **The Starry Sky**: Above the central figure, a large eight-pointed star dominates the sky, surrounded by seven smaller stars. The large star represents the guiding light of the universe, divine guidance, or the soul's purpose. The eight points of the star often symbolize regeneration and balance, as the number eight is associated with renewal and cycles in numerology. The seven smaller stars represent the seven chakras, indicating alignment, spiritual awakening, and the flow of energy through the body. Together, the stars suggest a connection to the cosmos, spiritual guidance, and the hope that comes from aligning with one's true purpose.

- **The Water**: The pool or river in the card represents the subconscious mind, emotions, and the flow of life. Water is a symbol of healing, intuition, and the ebb and flow of emotional experiences. The Water Bearer pouring water into the pool signifies the nourishment and replenishment of the subconscious, indicating that this is a time of emotional renewal and clarity.

- **The Land and Vegetation**: The land in the card represents the material world, the conscious mind, and the grounding of spiritual insights into practical reality. Often, lush greenery or a blooming tree appears in the background, symbolizing growth, fertility, and the potential for new life. The green landscape suggests that the seeds of hope and inspiration planted by The Star will grow and flourish in the material world.

- **The Bird (Ibis)**: In some depictions of The Star, a bird is perched on a tree or flying in the background. The bird, often an ibis, is associated with the Egyptian god Thoth, the deity of wisdom, writing, and magic. The presence of the bird symbolizes the communication between the spiritual and material worlds and the wisdom that comes from listening to one's inner voice. It also represents freedom and the higher consciousness that guides the querent through challenges.

The Star Upright Meaning
The Star Tarot card is about reconnecting one's soul with the divine -- the transcending of personality, family, community, and reputation. It has to do ultimately with the freedom to be one's self. The soul is responding to celestial influences -- forces that can provide the personality with a stronger sense of purpose. The Star card helps us to remember our exalted origins and our attraction to a higher union.
This card could also be called The Celestial Mandate -- that which refers us back to our reason for being, our mission in this lifetime. The Star reminds us that, in a sense, we are agents of divine will in our day-to-day lives. If we let go of the idea that we are supposed to be in control, we can more easily notice and appreciate the synchronicities that are nudging us along. In this way, we become more conscious of the invisible helping hand, and we better understand our place within -- and value to -- the larger cosmos.

The Star Reversed Meaning
The Star card reversed suggests that you are temporarily alienated from your brilliance and usefulness. You may feel clumsy, unskilled, at odds within your true nature.
Perhaps you are forgetting your soul's purpose in this lifetime. Focus on your unique gifts and talents -- their source is divine. It's your job to learn how to apply them in any situation your life offers you.
The Star Advice Position
The Star card advises that you rededicate yourself to your higher values, increase your spiritual cultivation and meditation practice, and surrender to the greater good. Connect to your higher self -- a being of a larger realm traveling on an evolutionary course that started long ago and runs indefinitely into the future. This is the part you wish to contact and communicate with.
Now is a period for quiet contemplation. Listen for the voice within. Anything that would interfere with this communion may not be serving your best interests right now.
The Star Love Position
The Star suggests that you may receive information from your higher self about the reason you came here -- to this planet at this time. This is a profoundly reorienting experience. As we touch our greater self, the eternal aspect, our personal lives and love relationships come into better perspective.
The feeling of being a stranger in a strange land vanishes. Great joy is inherent in this card's placement. You are consciously on the way home in a spiritual sense, no longer flailing in the dark.
The Star Career Position
When the Star is in this position, you may work with an individual who understands his or her true purpose, someone who has a mission in life. There is great wisdom available to this person and he or she is not caught up contesting the way things are. This is a person who lives their life from the inside out, uncontrolled by external events.
He or she maintains composure and accepts gracefully whatever unfolds in the workplace without needing to challenge the current circumstances. Ask yourself, What kind of trust does a person have to have to proceed with such openness? This accomplished soul provides a unique vision of one who harmonizes with life. And yes, this is something you could emulate and achieve for yourself!

The Star in a Yes or No Card Reading

Upright Love Meaning

optimistic about love life, healing from past wounds

Upright Star Tarot Love Meaning
Lots of hope in love and romance is signaled by the Star tarot love meaning. It’s likely that your sense of hope and optimism can be a powerful magnet for you right now, giving you a sense of charisma and charm. If you have been healing from a break up, this card suggests that you are well on your way, and you are slowly rebuilding your confidence so that you can move on. If your relationship has been going through a rough patch, this also may be a time of healing. So long as the two of you remain communicative and honest with one another, there is great potential for bringing the two of you closer together.

Upright Career Meaning

positivity brings career rewards, high hopes about job

Career Meaning - Upright Star
When it comes to work, remain faithful that your ambitions will be achieved. This can give you great positivity that others will notice, and can bring you the opportunities that you hoped for. Should you be searching for a new job or a promotion, the star is a reminder to keep your hopes high. If you’ve gone through a difficult or stressful time at work recently, the Star also signals a period of healing. This should be a quiet and peaceful time as you recuperate. 

Upright Finances Meaning

reaching financial goals, remaining inspired

Finances Meaning - Upright Star
When it comes to your finances, the Star signals that one’s faith and positivity should help you reach your financial goals. While you put in the work towards your financial future, also make sure to take the time to appreciate and be grateful for what you already have, as that can be inspiration for you to continue along this path. 

Reversed Star Meaning
When the Star card is reversed, it means that you are feeling as though everything has turned against you. The challenges that you would normally see as exciting seem instead to make you feel as though you cannot overcome them. You have lost faith in something, whether inside yourself or with something you normally find dear. 
Without hope, without faith, we cannot find the motivation to progress forward in the challenges that we face. Where in your life are you feeling hopeless? In what ways do you already feel defeated? And how does that affect your actions? The star reversed asks us to nurture our sense of hope and positive energy to help propel our actions with joy instead of fear.

Reversed Love Meaning

extreme self-criticism, loss of hope about romance, lack of confidence

Reversed Star Tarot Love Meaning
Self doubt and a loss of faith is clouding your judgement with the reversed Star’s appearance. Are you suffering from a loss of confidence? Do you pick at your own flaws with excessive harshness? What is making you feel unworthy of love? Others can sense this with you, and this can make you feel even worse while reinforcing your negative feelings about yourself. It is important now to remember all the wonderful things about yourself, so that you can see yourself as a worthy partner.   The doubt and loss of faith can also apply not just to yourself, but also to your feelings about love in general. If you have been single for a while, cynicism may make you believe that love only creates pain, or is an illusion that is not worth pursuing, when it is actually an attitude problem that pushes others away.

Reversed Career Meaning

lack of motivation, lack of enthusiasm, pessimism about work

Career Meaning - Reversed Star
With the reversed Star, it may be likely that your negativity is having an effect on your work. You may no longer feel enthusiastic or creative, because you can only see things in a pessimistic manner. Have your hopes not panned out? Have you given up faith that things can get better? When we despair, we make a bad situation worse, and the will to keep going can be snuffed out. It is likely that though things may be tense right now, it isn’t as bad as you seem to make of it. A change in your approach, perspective or attitude may be all that is needed in order to give you motivation to make positive changes. 

Reversed Finances Meaning

despair regarding financial situation

Finances Meaning - Reversed Star
If you have been struggling with finances, the reversed Star can suggest that not all hope is lost, but you may have already given up. There are likely things you can still do now to change your situation, but only if you can muster up the positivity to see things in a new light, and take action. Opening your heart to a more positive outlook can also open your eyes to opportunity.

The Star, the seventeenth card in the Tarot’s Major Arcana, is a symbol of hope, inspiration, renewal, and divine guidance. It often depicts a serene figure, typically a woman, pouring water from two vessels, with one foot on land and the other in water, under a starlit sky dominated by a large, radiant star. The Star card represents spiritual insight, the flow of life’s energy, and the harmonious balance between the material and spiritual realms. When viewed through the lens of Sacred Geometry, the symbolism of The Star card reveals profound connections to cosmic order, divine proportions, and the harmonious patterns that underlie existence. Here’s a detailed exploration of how Sacred Geometry applies to The Star card:

### 1. **The Number 17 (Symbol of Spiritual Insight and Rebirth)**
   - **17 as a Symbol of Transformation**: In numerology, the number 17 reduces to 8 (1 + 7 = 8), which is often associated with infinity, balance, and the eternal flow of energy. The number 8 symbolizes the balance between the material and spiritual realms, which is a central theme of The Star card. The number 17 itself symbolizes spiritual insight, renewal, and the transformative power of divine inspiration. In the context of The Star card, 17 represents the soul’s journey toward enlightenment, where hope and faith guide the individual through periods of renewal and growth.
   - **The Heptagon and Balance**: The number 7, which precedes 8, represents spiritual awakening and the quest for deeper understanding. The number 8, as a balance between the spiritual (7) and the material (4, symbolized by the square), reflects the harmony that The Star card embodies. This balance is achieved through the renewal and alignment of the soul’s energies, represented by the water being poured in the imagery of the card.

### 2. **The Star (Symbol of Divine Guidance and Cosmic Order)**
   - **The Eight-Pointed Star**: The star at the center of The Star card often has eight points, symbolizing regeneration, balance, and cosmic harmony. The number 8, in Sacred Geometry, is connected to the octagon, a shape that represents the intermediate stage between the square (earth) and the circle (heaven). The eight-pointed star, therefore, symbolizes the harmonious balance between the earthly and the divine, where the individual is guided by higher wisdom and spiritual insight. The Star card’s central star represents the divine light that illuminates the path toward spiritual renewal and enlightenment.
   - **The Star as a Mandala**: The star can also be seen as a mandala, a symbol of wholeness, unity, and the cosmic order. The mandala-like structure of the star in this card represents the interconnectedness of all things and the harmony that comes from aligning with the cosmic order. The Star card encourages the individual to find their place within this cosmic pattern, where they are guided by divine inspiration and connected to the greater whole.

### 3. **The Vesica Piscis (Symbol of Creation, Duality, and Divine Feminine)**
   - **The Vesica Piscis and the Flow of Life**: The Vesica Piscis, formed by the intersection of two circles, is a powerful symbol in Sacred Geometry that represents creation, duality, and the union of opposites. In The Star card, the Vesica Piscis can be seen in the imagery of the water being poured from the vessels, symbolizing the flow of life’s energy between the spiritual and material realms. The Vesica Piscis represents the gateway through which divine inspiration flows into the material world, bringing renewal and healing.
   - **Divine Feminine and Nurturing**: The Vesica Piscis is also associated with the Divine Feminine, symbolizing fertility, nurturing, and the creative power of the universe. In The Star card, this symbolism is reflected in the figure of the woman who pours the water, representing the nurturing and healing energy that flows from the divine into the material world. The Star card encourages the individual to connect with this divine feminine energy, which brings renewal, balance, and harmony to all aspects of life.

### 4. **The Circle (Symbol of Unity, Wholeness, and Eternal Flow)**
   - **The Circle of Renewal**: The circle, representing unity, wholeness, and eternity, is a fundamental symbol in Sacred Geometry. In The Star card, the circle symbolizes the eternal flow of life’s energy and the continuous process of renewal and regeneration. The water being poured from the vessels can be seen as a representation of this circular flow, where the energy of life is constantly being renewed and recycled. The circle’s unbroken line emphasizes the idea that true renewal and healing come from aligning with the natural flow of the universe, where all things are interconnected and part of a greater whole.
   - **Wholeness and Spiritual Enlightenment**: The circle also symbolizes wholeness, where the individual is connected to both the material and spiritual realms. In The Star card, this wholeness is achieved through the integration of all aspects of the self, where the individual finds balance and harmony by aligning with the cosmic order. The circle’s symbolism emphasizes the idea that true enlightenment comes from recognizing and embracing the interconnectedness of all things, where the individual is both a part of the whole and a reflection of the divine.

### 5. **The Hexagon and Hexagram (Symbol of Balance, Harmony, and Divine Order)**
   - **Hexagon as a Symbol of Divine Order**: The hexagon, with its six sides, represents balance, harmony, and the efficient structuring of energy. In the context of The Star card, the hexagon symbolizes the divine order that governs the universe, where all things are in balance and harmony. The Star card’s imagery often reflects this balance, where the water being poured from the vessels symbolizes the harmonious flow of energy between the spiritual and material realms. The hexagon’s symmetry emphasizes the importance of maintaining this balance, where the individual is guided by divine inspiration and connected to the greater whole.
   - **Hexagram (Star of David)**: The hexagram, or Star of David, is formed by the interlocking of two equilateral triangles, symbolizing the union of opposites—spiritual and material, light and dark. In The Star card, the hexagram represents the integration of these dualities, where the individual finds balance and harmony by aligning with the divine order. The hexagram’s perfect symmetry reflects the idea that true enlightenment comes from the harmonious integration of all aspects of existence, where the individual is both grounded in the material world and connected to the spiritual realm.

### 6. **The Triangle (Symbol of Aspiration, Spiritual Growth, and Divine Harmony)**
   - **The Triangle of Spiritual Aspiration**: The triangle, particularly when pointing upwards, is a symbol of aspiration, spiritual growth, and the integration of body, mind, and spirit. In The Star card, the triangle represents the upward movement of the soul toward enlightenment and divine inspiration. The Star card encourages the individual to strive for spiritual growth, where they are guided by the divine light of the star and supported by the harmonious flow of energy in the universe.
   - **Harmony Through Integration**: The triangle’s three sides also represent the integration of the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of the self. In The Star card, this integration is symbolized by the balance between the water being poured on land (representing the physical world) and in the water (representing the spiritual realm). The triangle’s symbolism emphasizes the importance of finding harmony within oneself, where all aspects of the self are aligned with the divine order and the flow of life’s energy.

### 7. **The Pentagram (Symbol of Balance, Protection, and Manifestation)**
   - **Pentagram as a Symbol of Balance**: The pentagram, a five-pointed star, traditionally represents the harmony of the five elements—earth, air, fire, water, and spirit—with the spirit element at the top. In The Star card, the pentagram symbolizes the balance and harmony that comes from the alignment of these elements. The pentagram’s connection to the elements reflects the idea that true renewal and healing come from the harmonious integration of all aspects of existence, where the individual is connected to both the material and spiritual realms.
   - **Protection and Divine Guidance**: The pentagram is also a symbol of protection, where the individual is shielded by the divine light of the star. In The Star card, this protection is symbolized by the guidance and inspiration that comes from aligning with the cosmic order, where the individual is supported by the harmonious flow of energy in the universe. The pentagram’s symbolism emphasizes the importance of trusting in divine guidance and allowing the light of the star to illuminate the path toward renewal and enlightenment.

### 8. **The Flower of Life (Symbol of Interconnectedness, Unity, and the Blueprint of Existence)**
   - **The Flower of Life as the Blueprint of Harmony**: The Flower of Life, a complex geometric pattern composed of overlapping circles, symbolizes the interconnectedness of all life and the underlying blueprint of existence. In The Star card, the Flower of Life represents the idea that all things are interconnected and part of a greater whole, where the harmonious flow of energy creates balance and unity. The Star card’s imagery often reflects this interconnectedness, where the water being poured from the vessels symbolizes the continuous flow of life’s energy, connecting the material and spiritual realms.
   - **Unity Through Divine Inspiration**: The Flower of Life also symbolizes unity, where the individual is connected to both the material and spiritual realms. In The Star card, this unity is achieved through the alignment with the divine order, where the individual is guided by the light of the star and connected to the greater whole. The Flower of Life’s intricate design reflects the complexity of the forces that drive The Star card, where the individual  finds balance and harmony by recognizing and embracing the interconnectedness of all things.

### 9. **The Mandala (Symbol of Wholeness, Cosmic Order, and Spiritual Enlightenment)**
   - **The Mandala of Spiritual Enlightenment**: The mandala, a complex geometric design that represents the universe and cosmic order, is a symbol of wholeness, unity, and the process of spiritual enlightenment. In The Star card, the mandala represents the individual’s journey toward wholeness and enlightenment, where they are guided by the divine light of the star and supported by the harmonious flow of energy in the universe. The Star card’s imagery often reflects the mandala’s symbolism, where the water being poured from the vessels symbolizes the continuous flow of life’s energy, bringing renewal and healing to all aspects of existence.
   - **Centering and Alignment with Cosmic Order**: The mandala’s central point represents the core of the self, where all aspects of the individual are unified and brought into balance. In The Star card, this centering is achieved through the alignment with the cosmic order, where the individual finds harmony and balance by connecting with the divine light of the star. The mandala’s circular shape emphasizes the idea that true enlightenment comes from recognizing and embracing the interconnectedness of all things, where the individual is both a part of the whole and a reflection of the divine.

### 10. **The Torus (Symbol of Continuous Flow, Energy, and Divine Harmony)**
   - **The Torus of Divine Harmony**: The torus is a geometric shape that represents the concept of flow, energy, and continuous cycles. In The Star card, the torus symbolizes the continuous flow of life’s energy, where the individual is connected to both the material and spiritual realms. The water being poured from the vessels can be seen as a representation of this toroidal flow, where the energy of life is constantly being renewed and recycled. The torus’s shape reflects the idea that true harmony and balance come from aligning with the natural flow of the universe, where all things are interconnected and part of a greater whole.
   - **Continuous Renewal and Healing**: The torus also symbolizes the process of continuous renewal and healing, where the individual is constantly evolving and growing through the flow of life’s energy.
