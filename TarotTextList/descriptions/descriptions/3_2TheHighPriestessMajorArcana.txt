The High Priestess is the second card in the Major Arcana of the Tarot, symbolizing intuition, subconscious knowledge, and the mysteries of the unknown. Positioned as card number II, The High Priestess represents the gateway to the deeper aspects of the psyche, where hidden truths and inner wisdom reside. She embodies the balance between the conscious and unconscious mind, serving as a bridge between the seen and unseen, the known and the unknown.

### Symbolism and Imagery

The imagery of The High Priestess is rich with symbols that convey her connection to the mystical and the divine. She is typically depicted sitting on a throne between two pillars, with a veil behind her, suggesting that she guards the entrance to hidden knowledge. Her expression is serene and introspective, indicating her deep inner awareness and understanding.

- **The Pillars (Boaz and Jachin)**: The High Priestess is often shown seated between two pillars, usually labeled "Boaz" and "Jachin." These pillars are references to the two pillars that stood at the entrance to Solomon’s Temple and represent duality—masculine and feminine, light and dark, active and passive. Boaz, on the left, symbolizes strength, while Jachin, on the right, symbolizes establishment. Together, they represent the balance between opposing forces, suggesting that true knowledge and wisdom come from the integration of these dualities.

- **The Veil**: Behind The High Priestess is a veil, often decorated with pomegranates, that separates the material world from the spiritual realm. The veil symbolizes the boundary between the conscious and subconscious mind, and the mysteries that lie beyond it. Pomegranates, a symbol of fertility and abundance, also hint at the richness of the knowledge that lies hidden behind the veil.

- **The Moon and Water**: The High Priestess is closely associated with the moon, which is often depicted at her feet or in her crown. The moon symbolizes intuition, the feminine, and the cyclical nature of life. It also represents the ebb and flow of the tides, which are influenced by the moon, reflecting the ever-changing nature of emotions and the subconscious. Water, another element associated with The High Priestess, symbolizes the subconscious mind, emotions, and the depths of inner knowledge. The calm waters suggest the deep, still wisdom that lies within.

- **The Scroll (TORA)**: The High Priestess often holds a scroll, partially covered, that is labeled "TORA." This scroll represents the Torah, or divine law, indicating that The High Priestess is a keeper of sacred knowledge. The fact that the scroll is partially hidden suggests that not all knowledge is meant to be revealed or understood at once; some truths must be discovered through introspection and inner exploration.

- **The Crown**: The High Priestess is often depicted wearing a crown, which may take the form of the triple moon symbol (waxing, full, and waning moon). This crown represents her connection to the divine feminine, her role as a goddess or high priestess, and her mastery over the cycles of nature and the subconscious mind.

- **The Cross**: A cross is sometimes depicted on The High Priestess’s chest, symbolizing the balance of the four elements and the integration of spiritual and material realities.

There is no need to take the actions and reactions going on at your workplace personally. Be grateful that you still possess a strong sense of objectivity. It takes willpower to resist the urge to form opinions, take sides or sit in judgment. Watch closely but hold your emotions in check.

The High Priestess, the second card in the Tarot's Major Arcana, represents intuition, hidden knowledge, the subconscious mind, and the bridge between the seen and unseen worlds. She is the guardian of the mysteries, standing at the threshold between the conscious and unconscious, the known and the unknown. Through the lens of Sacred Geometry, the symbolism of the High Priestess deepens, revealing connections to cosmic patterns, divine proportions, and the interplay between dualities. Here’s a detailed exploration of how Sacred Geometry applies to The High Priestess:

### 1. **The Vesica Piscis (Gateway to the Mysteries)**
   - **Symbol of the Womb of Creation**: The Vesica Piscis, created by the intersection of two circles, is one of the most potent symbols in Sacred Geometry, representing the womb from which all creation springs. The High Priestess, often depicted seated between two pillars, stands at the threshold of this sacred space. The Vesica Piscis is the gateway to hidden knowledge, symbolizing the intersection between the material and spiritual worlds, where mysteries are both concealed and revealed. The High Priestess, as the guardian of this gateway, embodies the profound connection between the divine feminine and the creative force of the universe.
   - **Duality and Balance**: The two circles forming the Vesica Piscis represent duality—light and dark, conscious and unconscious, masculine and feminine. The High Priestess sits between these opposing forces, balancing them within herself. Her ability to navigate and integrate these dualities allows her to access the deeper truths hidden within the Vesica Piscis, making her the embodiment of balance and harmony between opposites.

### 2. **The Pillars (Symbol of Duality and Balance)**
   - **Jachin and Boaz**: In most depictions, the High Priestess sits between two pillars labeled Jachin and Boaz, which represent duality—masculine and feminine, strength and wisdom, severity and mercy. These pillars are reminiscent of the two circles of the Vesica Piscis and symbolize the balance between opposing forces. In Sacred Geometry, the concept of duality is essential, and the High Priestess's position between the pillars emphasizes her role as the mediator between these forces.
   - **The Equilibrium of Opposites**: The pillars also signify the equilibrium that the High Priestess maintains between the physical and spiritual worlds. This balance is crucial for accessing the hidden knowledge she guards. In Sacred Geometry, balance and proportion are foundational principles, and the High Priestess’s presence between the pillars symbolizes the perfect balance necessary to access deeper wisdom and intuition.

### 3. **The Circle and the Moon (Symbol of Cycles and Intuition)**
   - **The Circle as Wholeness**: The circle, symbolizing wholeness and unity, is also closely associated with the moon, a key symbol in the High Priestess card. The moon represents cycles, intuition, and the unconscious mind—domains over which the High Priestess has mastery. The circle, as a symbol of the moon, emphasizes the cyclical nature of time, emotions, and spiritual growth, all of which are central to the High Priestess’s domain.
   - **The Crescent Moon**: The crescent moon at the High Priestess’s feet (or in her crown) is a direct reference to the cycles of the moon, which govern the tides, emotions, and the feminine principle. In Sacred Geometry, the circle and its phases symbolize the continuous cycle of birth, growth, death, and rebirth. The High Priestess’s connection to the moon highlights her deep understanding of these cycles and her ability to navigate the ebb and flow of intuitive knowledge.

### 4. **The Spiral (Symbol of Growth and Evolution)**
   - **The Unfolding of Inner Knowledge**: The spiral, a recurring motif in Sacred Geometry, represents growth, evolution, and the unfolding of inner knowledge. The High Priestess, as the keeper of the mysteries, guides the seeker through the spiral journey of self-discovery and spiritual evolution. The spiral's continuous and expanding path symbolizes the High Priestess’s role in guiding the soul through the layers of the subconscious, revealing deeper truths and wisdom as the seeker progresses.
   - **The Path of the Feminine**: The spiral is also closely associated with the feminine principle, which the High Priestess embodies. It represents the intuitive and non-linear path of spiritual growth, where knowledge is not acquired in a straight line but through an inward journey that spirals toward deeper understanding. The High Priestess’s wisdom is not accessible through logic alone; it requires surrendering to the spiral path of intuition and inner exploration.

### 5. **The Triangle (Symbol of Trinity and Integration)**
   - **The Triple Goddess**: The triangle, with its three sides, is a symbol of the trinity in Sacred Geometry. The High Priestess is often associated with the Triple Goddess archetype—Maiden, Mother, and Crone—representing the three phases of the moon and the stages of feminine wisdom. The triangle's connection to the number three also reflects the High Priestess's ability to integrate and balance the three aspects of the self: body, mind, and spirit. This trinity is essential for accessing the deeper layers of the subconscious that the High Priestess governs.
   - **Integration of Knowledge**: The triangle also symbolizes the integration of knowledge from the material, mental, and spiritual realms. The High Priestess, as the mediator between these realms, facilitates the synthesis of this knowledge, allowing the seeker to access a more holistic understanding of the universe. The triangle's stability and balance are reflected in the High Priestess's ability to maintain harmony between these realms, ensuring that the wisdom she guards is accessed with reverence and integrity.

### 6. **The Cube (Foundation of Hidden Knowledge)**
   - **The Foundation of the Temple**: The cube, a symbol of stability and the material world, is associated with the foundations of sacred structures, such as temples. The High Priestess is often depicted sitting before a veil or temple entrance, suggesting her role as the guardian of sacred knowledge. The cube, in Sacred Geometry, represents the material foundation upon which spiritual knowledge is built. The High Priestess's connection to the temple and the veil symbolizes her role in protecting the sacred knowledge that lies beyond the physical world.
   - **Veil of the Temple**: The veil behind the High Priestess, often adorned with pomegranates and palm leaves, symbolizes the separation between the known and the unknown, the seen and the unseen. The cube’s symbolism as a stable, foundational structure is mirrored in the veil’s role as the boundary between the conscious and subconscious. The High Priestess stands as the gateway, holding the key to what lies beyond the veil—the hidden, esoteric knowledge of the universe.

### 7. **The Merkaba (Divine Protection and Ascension)**
   - **The Light Body of Wisdom**: The Merkaba, a star tetrahedron, represents the divine light body used for ascension in spiritual practices. The High Priestess, as a spiritual guide, is surrounded and protected by the Merkaba’s energy. This symbol reflects her connection to higher realms and her ability to access divine wisdom. The Merkaba also represents the integration of spirit and matter, a balance that the High Priestess embodies as she navigates the realms of the conscious and unconscious.
   - **Ascension through Knowledge**: The High Priestess’s role is to guide the seeker through the process of ascension, using the wisdom she guards. The Merkaba’s structure, with its interconnected tetrahedrons, symbolizes the multi-dimensional nature of the knowledge she protects. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but spiritual, requiring the seeker to ascend to higher levels of consciousness to fully comprehend it.

### 8. **The Flower of Life (Symbol of Universal Patterns and Interconnection)**
   - **Guardian of Universal Wisdom**: The Flower of Life, with its intricate pattern of overlapping circles, symbolizes the interconnectedness of all life and the blueprint of creation. The High Priestess, as the guardian of hidden wisdom, holds the key to understanding these universal patterns. The Flower of Life represents the knowledge of the universe’s structure, which the High Priestess can access and reveal to those who are ready. This knowledge includes the fundamental truths about the nature of reality, the soul, and the cosmos.
   - **Accessing the Akashic Records**: The Flower of Life is also connected to the concept of the Akashic Records, the universal library of all knowledge and experiences. The High Priestess, with her deep connection to the subconscious and the spiritual realms, can access this cosmic database. The patterns within the Flower of Life symbolize the interconnectedness of all experiences and knowledge, which the High Priestess can tap into and reveal to those who seek her wisdom.

### 9. **The Platonic Solids (Elements of Creation and Cosmic Order)**
   - **Wisdom of the Elements**: The Platonic solids represent the building blocks of the universe, each corresponding to an element—fire, earth, air, water, and ether. The High Priestess’s connection to these elements is reflected in her deep understanding of the natural and cosmic orders. Her wisdom encompasses not only the physical elements but also the spiritual essence behind them. The High Priestess’s knowledge is not just esoteric but deeply rooted in the natural laws of the universe, symbolized by the Platonic solids.
   - **Harmony and Balance**: The Platonic solids also symbolize the harmony and balance that the High Priestess maintains in her role as the mediator between worlds. Her ability to balance these elements within herself allows her to access and guard the sacred knowledge that they represent. This balance is crucial for the seeker to achieve in their quest for wisdom, as it ensures that they are in harmony with the cosmic order.

### 10. **The Dodecahedron (Symbol of the Universe and the Ether)**
   - **Connection to the Divine**: The dodecahedron, associated with the element of ether, represents the universe and the divine. The High Priestess’s connection to the dodecahedron symbolizes her role as the mediator between the physical world and the divine realms. The dodecahedron’s twelve faces correspond to the zodiac, further emphasizing the High Priestess’s connection to the cosmic cycles and her ability to access divine knowledge. Her wisdom transcends the physical and taps into the etheric realms, where the mysteries of the universe are revealed.
   - **The Sacred Knowledge of the Cosmos**: The High Priestess’s role as the guardian of sacred knowledge is mirrored in the dodecahedron’s symbolism as the shape of the universe. Her ability to access and protect this knowledge ensures that it is revealed only to those who are prepared to receive it. The dodecahedron also represents the unity of all things, a principle that the High Priestess embodies as she navigates the realms of the seen and unseen, the known and unknown.
