**The Lovers** is the sixth card in the Major Arcana of the Tarot, symbolizing love, relationships, and the complex dynamics of human connections. This card is deeply rooted in themes of harmony, duality, and the choices we make in matters of the heart. It often signifies deep emotional connections, romantic relationships, and the union of opposites, but its meaning can also extend to broader concepts of balance, choice, and moral alignment.

### Symbolism and Imagery

The imagery of The Lovers card is rich with symbolism that speaks to the themes of love, unity, and decision-making. The traditional depiction often includes a man and a woman standing beneath an angel or divine figure, representing the divine blessing or guidance in their union.

- **The Man and Woman**: The central figures of The Lovers card are typically a man and a woman, standing together in a harmonious and balanced stance. This pairing symbolizes the union of opposites—masculine and feminine, conscious and subconscious, earthly and spiritual. They represent the duality inherent in human relationships and the coming together of two complementary forces. Their nudity often suggests innocence, honesty, and vulnerability in their connection, emphasizing the pure and open nature of their relationship.

- **The Angel (Raphael)**: Above the couple, an angel, often identified as Raphael, the archangel of healing and protection, hovers with wings outstretched. Raphael's presence signifies the divine blessing on the union and the idea that true love is a sacred and spiritual connection. The angel’s role is to guide the couple, not just in their relationship with each other, but also in their relationship with the divine and with themselves. Raphael’s guidance also points to the importance of communication and healing in relationships.

- **The Garden of Eden**: The setting of The Lovers card is frequently depicted as the Garden of Eden, with the man standing before the Tree of Life and the woman before the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. This biblical reference brings deeper layers of meaning to the card, particularly regarding temptation, choice, and the consequences of those choices. The serpent coiled around the Tree of Knowledge symbolizes temptation and the potential for sin, echoing the story of Adam and Eve. This imagery suggests that love and relationships often involve choices that can lead to spiritual growth or downfall, depending on how they are navigated.

- **The Trees**: The trees behind the man and woman carry significant symbolic weight. The Tree of Life, behind the man, represents vitality, connection to the divine, and the potential for spiritual growth. The Tree of Knowledge, behind the woman, is often linked with awareness, wisdom, and the dual nature of existence (good and evil, right and wrong). Together, these trees symbolize the choice between a purely spiritual path and one that involves the challenges of knowledge and moral decision-making.

- **The Sun**: The sun shines brightly above the scene, casting its warm, golden light on the figures below. The sun represents clarity, truth, and the life-giving energy that sustains all living things. In The Lovers card, it suggests that love and relationships are meant to be life-affirming and filled with light. The sun also indicates that the choices made in love should be guided by truth and transparency.

- **The Mountain**: A mountain often appears in the background of The Lovers card, symbolizing the challenges and obstacles that are inherent in any relationship. The mountain represents the trials that lovers must face together, the heights they can achieve, and the spiritual journey that their union can represent. It also suggests that love is not just about harmony and union, but also about growth, challenge, and the strength required to overcome difficulties together.

The Lovers Upright Meaning
Although it has taken on a strictly romantic revision of meaning in some modern decks, traditionally The Lovers Tarot card reflected the challenges of choosing a partner. At a crossroads, one cannot take both paths. The images on this card in different decks have varied more than most, because we have had so many ways of looking at sex and relationships across cultures and centuries.
Classically, the energy of this card reminded us of the real challenges posed by romantic relationships, with the protagonist often shown in the act of making an either-or choice. To partake of a higher ideal often requires sacrificing the lesser option. The path of pleasure eventually leads to distraction from spiritual growth. The gratification of the personality eventually gives way to a call from spirit as the soul matures.
Modern decks tend to portray the feeling of romantic love with this card, showing Adam and Eve at the gates of Eden when everything was still perfect. This interpretation portrays humanity before the fall, and can be thought to imply a different sort of choice -- the choice of evolution over perfection, or the choice of personal growth through relationship -- instead of a fantasy where everything falls into place perfectly and is taken care of without effort.
The Lovers Reversed Meaning
The Lovers card reversed may indicate that you are going along with a divided situation because you have a vested interest in opposition. You can't resolve this situation until you own up to your own double standard.
Admit the resistance you feel, instead of proceeding halfheartedly or with unspoken resentments. In such an important area of your life, you should not just go along to get along.
The Lovers Advice Position
The Lovers card advises that you study your options and make the wisest choice. Carefully consider your long-term interests. There is no judgment on what you choose to keep from the array of possibilities before you. Just watch out for choices that will produce dissatisfaction and discontent.
Be willing to make some compromises, then stick with the commitments you finally make. Trust your intuition along with your rational intellect, and once you make your choice, carry it out with conviction.
The Lovers Love Position
The Lovers symbolize attraction and choices. Perhaps you are torn within yourself. One side is instinctive, emotional, intuitive, sensual, and magical. The other is lucid, highly principled, rational, and attuned to social and cultural elements. We have a wild child and a cultured, mature adult self.
You have some trust for each of them, but you may not believe they can merge in a forthcoming relationship with your next partner. Whenever the Lovers card appears, you must either integrate two entities or let go of one of them. You would do well to consider how the consequences of these choices will impact on what you want out of a future relationship.
The Lovers Career Position
When the Lovers card appears in this position, you may be coming to a fork in the road. Only one destination can be chosen; the other must be let go of. It may be the destination you are trying to reach that will guide you in choosing which work setting and work associates would be best for you to cultivate. When objectivity is lacking, you have to use your intuition. You need to sense the inner workings of the players involved as well as looking at what's inside of you.
If you take some time, go within and are honest with yourself, you will make the appropriate alliances. However, if you are just fooling around, it could turn out to be a costly career decision.

The Lovers in a Yes or No Card Reading

The Lovers Tarot Card Description
In the Lovers card, the man and the woman in the image are being protected and blessed by an angel above. The couple seems secure and happy in their home, which appears to be the Garden of Eden. The fruit tree with the snake behind the woman is a reference to that story, which tells of humanity's fall into temptation and into the realm of flesh and sensuality. The angel depicted here is Raphael, the angel of air - who is of the same element of the zodiac sign that governs this card: Gemini. Air is associated with mental activity, and communication in particular, which is the foundation for healthy relationships. His blessing seems to give this card a sense of balance and harmony, the symbolization of union in a grand and cosmic sense between two opposing forces. 

The primary meaning within the Lovers is harmony, attractiveness, and perfection in a relationship. The trust and the unity that the lovers have gives each of them confidence and strength, empowering the other. The bond that they have created is very strong, and it can indicate that the two are joined in marriage, and other close and intimate relationships.
The trust and the unity that the lovers have gives each of them confidence and strength, empowering the other.
Another meaning behind the lovers card is the concept of choice - a choice between things that are opposing and mutually exclusive. This could be a dilemma that you need to think about carefully and make the best decision for your situation.  A more personal Lovers meaning that can apply to individuals is the development of your own personal belief systems, regardless of what are the societal norms. We see this as a development from the Hierophant, who made decrees and passed on his knowledge through a standardized system. This is one of the times when you figure out what you are going to stand for, and what your philosophy in life will truly be. You must start making up your mind about what you find important and unimportant in your life. You should be as true to yourself as you can be, so you will be genuine and authentic to the people who are around you.

Upright Lovers Tarot Love Meaning
When it comes to love and relationships, the Lovers card can be a welcome sight to any seeker. The Lovers tarot card signals a wonderful cohesiveness and balance of forces, indicating complimentary energies. This card represents a pair that works well together. On the other hand, because this card also symbolizes choice, and the choice of commitment, it also raises questions of how committed you are to love. This doesn’t have to refer exclusively to another person, but can also indicate a choice between love or work, love or family, love or friendship, or even sometimes love and your entire lifestyle. The idea here is that there may be a sacrifice that you must make in order to have this love. In some ways, all commitment is a sacrifice, but one made for the right person can help you grow as an individual. The choices and sacrifices that need to be made can apply to both you, a potential or existing partner.

business partnership, romance at work, choices about career

Career Meaning - Upright Lovers
Sometimes, the Lovers can signal a business partnership, or a relationship with a colleague that is harmonious and beneficial to both parties. The Lovers card, contrary to popular belief, can also symbolize partnerships of a platonic kind, though at times, this can also signal a romantic relationship that can blossom. If this does happen, make sure you understand the kinds of risk that you open yourself up to, and make a decision both with your head as well as your heart. The Lovers tarot card can also suggest that there are big decisions that you need to make when it comes to your future career. You may be at a crossroads, or shifting from one path to another, or you may need to make choices between your work and other aspects of your life.

Upright Finances Meaning

mutually exclusive financial choices

Finances Meaning - Upright Lovers
When it comes to finances, the Lovers card can suggest that big financial decisions need to be made. You may have to choose between having one big expense versus another; the important thing to remember is that it seems like you can’t have both. One path closes the door to another path, and your choices may have larger impacts in the future.

Reversed Lovers Meaning
The Lovers reversed can point to both inner and outer conflicts that you are dealing with. The disharmony can make daily life difficult and could be putting pressure on your relationships. You should take time to think about what you are punishing yourself for, so you can fix them or let them go. At this time, you should also think about your personal values and belief system to make sure that they are aligned with what you want from your life.
A break in communication could be another possible interpretation. The foundation for your relationships may be cut off, creating an imbalance between you and your partner or loved ones. The unity normally present within the card has become lopsided. 
The Lovers reversed can also indicate that you have been avoiding responsibility for your actions. You could have made a decision that was based on your desire for immediate gratification but are now blaming others for the consequences that are catching up to you. So, you need to make amends or let go of the past and make better decisions in the future.

Reversed Love Meaning

cold, detached partner, too many suitors, imbalance in relationship

Sometimes, a fear of commitment may also be indicated. This may be a time when you have many suitors, or your dating life may be very active. While this may be fun at first, you may be feeling that there are too many choices, or too many possibilities that you have to give up in order to develop a partnership. This will likely require some introspection on your part; make sure you are honest with yourself about your fears as well as your desires.

Reversed Career Meaning

conflicts between colleagues, romance at work leading to trouble

Both colleagues may be dragged down because of one person’s inability to put in their fair share of work. At times, this card does indicate a romantic relationship started at your workplace, but reversed, this can spell trouble for you. There are likely to be consequences that you did not foresee should you continue down this path. 

Reversed Finances Meaning

impulsive financial choices, not responsible about finances

The Lovers, the sixth card in the Tarot’s Major Arcana, represents love, relationships, choices, and the union of opposites. This card is often depicted with a man and a woman standing beneath an angel, symbolizing divine love and guidance. The Lovers card explores themes of harmony, duality, and the integration of polarities. When examined through the lens of Sacred Geometry, the symbolism of The Lovers deepens, revealing intricate connections to cosmic patterns, the balance of forces, and the union of complementary energies. Here’s a detailed exploration of how Sacred Geometry applies to The Lovers:

### 1. **The Number 6 (Symbol of Harmony, Balance, and Integration)**
   - **The Hexagon**: The number 6 is associated with the hexagon, a geometric shape that symbolizes harmony, balance, and the integration of opposites. The hexagon is found in nature, such as in honeycombs, and represents efficiency and unity. In the context of The Lovers, the hexagon embodies the perfect balance that exists in a harmonious relationship. The six-sided figure symbolizes the union of two distinct entities (the lovers) into a stable and unified whole, reflecting the theme of integration that is central to this card.
   - **Six-Pointed Star (Hexagram)**: The hexagram, or the Star of David, is another powerful symbol associated with the number 6. It is formed by the interlocking of two equilateral triangles, representing the union of masculine and feminine, heaven and earth, spirit and matter. The Lovers card, through the hexagram, emphasizes the sacred union of opposites, suggesting that true love involves the merging of these complementary forces into a balanced and harmonious relationship. The hexagram’s interlocking triangles also symbolize the dynamic interplay between these forces, where each enhances and completes the other.

### 2. **The Vesica Piscis (Symbol of Union and Creation)**
   - **Sacred Union**: The Vesica Piscis, formed by the intersection of two circles, is a central symbol in Sacred Geometry representing the union of dualities and the creation of new life. The Lovers card mirrors this concept, as it depicts the sacred union of two individuals, whose love creates something greater than themselves—a new entity, relationship, or path. The Vesica Piscis, as the symbol of the divine feminine and the womb of creation, highlights the generative power of love and the potential for new beginnings that arise from the union of opposites.
   - **Balancing Polarities**: The Vesica Piscis also represents the balance of polarities—masculine and feminine, active and passive, light and dark. The Lovers card, through this symbol, emphasizes the importance of balance and harmony in relationships. Just as the Vesica Piscis creates a new space where the circles overlap, the relationship depicted in The Lovers card creates a new dynamic where the energies of both partners merge and complement each other. This balance is crucial for the relationship to thrive and for the individuals involved to grow and evolve together.

### 3. **The Tree of Life (Symbol of Choices and Pathways)**
   - **The Pillars and the Paths**: The Lovers card often depicts two figures standing between two trees, which can be seen as a reference to the Tree of Life in Kabbalistic teachings. The Tree of Life represents the various paths and choices available to individuals on their spiritual journey. The Lovers, positioned at a crossroads, symbolize the choices that must be made to align with one’s true path. The pillars of the Tree of Life also represent duality—mercy and severity, active and passive. The Lovers card emphasizes the importance of making conscious choices that lead to the integration of these dual forces, creating a balanced and harmonious life.
   - **Union of Tiferet and the Heart**: On the Tree of Life, the Sephirah Tiferet represents beauty, harmony, and the heart center, where the energies of the divine and the human intersect. The Lovers card is deeply connected to Tiferet, as it symbolizes the heart-centered union of two souls. This union is not just romantic but also spiritual, reflecting the merging of the divine masculine and feminine within each individual. The Tree of Life, with its interconnected paths and Sephiroth, underscores the idea that true love involves navigating the complexities of life and making choices that lead to spiritual growth and fulfillment.

### 4. **The Circle and the Mandorla (Symbol of Wholeness and Completion)**
   - **Wholeness and Unity**: The circle, a symbol of unity, wholeness, and eternity, is closely associated with The Lovers card. In Sacred Geometry, the circle represents the perfect, unbroken unity of the cosmos. The Lovers, through their union, create a circle of wholeness, where their individual energies combine to form a complete and balanced whole. This unity is the essence of true love, where each partner complements and completes the other, creating a relationship that is greater than the sum of its parts.
   - **The Mandorla (Vesica Piscis)**: The mandorla, an almond-shaped figure created by the overlapping of two circles (the Vesica Piscis), is a powerful symbol of union and integration. It represents the sacred space where dualities meet and merge, creating something new and whole. The Lovers card, through the mandorla, emphasizes the sacredness of the relationship and the transformative power of love. The mandorla also symbolizes the intersection of the spiritual and physical realms, where the love between the two figures is both a spiritual and earthly union.

### 5. **The Spiral (Symbol of Growth, Evolution, and Cycles)**
   - **The Spiral of Love**: The spiral, a fundamental symbol in Sacred Geometry, represents growth, evolution, and the cyclical nature of life. In the context of The Lovers card, the spiral symbolizes the dynamic and evolving nature of love and relationships. Love is not a static state but a continuous process of growth, where both partners evolve individually and together. The spiral’s ever-expanding path mirrors the journey of love, where each experience deepens the connection and leads to greater understanding and harmony.
   - **Evolution of the Soul**: The spiral also represents the evolution of the soul, where love plays a crucial role in spiritual development. The Lovers card, through the spiral, suggests that relationships are a key part of the soul’s journey, offering opportunities for growth, learning, and transformation. The spiral’s connection to the cycles of life emphasizes the idea that love is a process that unfolds over time, with each phase bringing new challenges and rewards.

### 6. **The Flower of Life (Symbol of Interconnection and Creation)**
   - **The Blueprint of Love**: The Flower of Life, a complex geometric figure composed of overlapping circles, symbolizes the interconnectedness of all life and the blueprint of creation. In the context of The Lovers card, the Flower of Life represents the interconnectedness of the two individuals and the creation of a new reality through their union. This symbol emphasizes the idea that love is a creative force, capable of bringing new life and new possibilities into existence. The Lovers, through their relationship, tap into this creative energy, manifesting a reality that reflects their shared values, dreams, and desires.
   - **Unity in Diversity**: The Flower of Life also represents the unity of all forms of life, suggesting that the love depicted in The Lovers card is part of a greater cosmic pattern. The individual circles within the Flower of Life symbolize the diversity of experiences and perspectives, while their interconnectedness reflects the underlying unity of all things. The Lovers card emphasizes the idea that true love involves embracing both the differences and the similarities between partners, creating a relationship that is rich, diverse, and harmonious.

### 7. **The Pentagram (Symbol of Balance and Human Experience)**
   - **The Five Elements**: The pentagram, with its five points, symbolizes the five elements—earth, air, fire, water, and spirit. The Lovers card, through the pentagram, emphasizes the importance of balance and harmony between these elements in a relationship. Each element represents a different aspect of the human experience, and true love involves integrating these aspects into a balanced and harmonious whole. The pentagram’s connection to the human form also suggests that love is a deeply human experience, rooted in both the physical and spiritual dimensions of life.
   - **Spirit Over Matter**: The upright pentagram symbolizes the triumph of spirit over matter, reflecting the idea that true love transcends the material realm and connects to the spiritual. The Lovers card, through this symbol, emphasizes the importance of aligning with higher spiritual principles in a relationship, ensuring that the connection is not just physical but also spiritual. The pentagram’s balance between the elements reflects the balance needed in a relationship for it to be truly fulfilling and aligned with the divine.

### 8. **The Triangle (Symbol of Trinity and Sacred Union)**
   - **Trinity of Love**: The triangle, with its three sides, is a symbol of the trinity, representing the unity of body, mind, and spirit. The Lovers card, through the triangle, emphasizes the importance of integrating these three aspects in a relationship. True love involves not just a physical connection but also an emotional and spiritual bond, creating a relationship that is complete and balanced. The triangle’s stability and strength reflect the foundation needed for a lasting and harmonious relationship.
   - **Sacred Union**: The triangle also represents the sacred union of opposites, where two become one. In the context of The Lovers card, the triangle symbolizes the merging of masculine and feminine energies, creating a balanced and harmonious whole. This union is not just about the physical merging of two individuals but also the integration of their spiritual and emotional energies, creating a relationship that is sacred and transformative.

### 9. **The Cube (Symbol of Stability and Foundation)**
   - **Foundation of Love**: The cube, a symbol of stability and structure, represents the foundation needed for a strong and lasting relationship. The Lovers card, through the cube, emphasizes the importance of building a relationship on a solid foundation, where both partners are grounded and committed. The cube’s six faces also reflect the need for balance and equality in a relationship, where both partners contribute equally to the stability and growth of the union.
   - **Earthly Manifestation**: The cube is also associated with the element of earth, symbolizing the material and physical aspects of a relationship. The Lovers card, through the cube, suggests that true love involves not just spiritual and emotional connections but also practical considerations, where the relationship is grounded in the realities of everyday life. The cube’s connection to the material world reflects the idea that love is not just an abstract concept but something that must be manifested and nurtured in the physical realm.

### 10. **The Mandala (Symbol of Wholeness and Cosmic Order)**
   - **Mandala of Love**: The mandala, a complex geometric design that represents the universe and cosmic order, is a symbol of wholeness and unity. The Lovers card, through the mandala, emphasizes the idea that true love is a reflection of the greater cosmic order, where the union of two individuals is part of the divine plan. The mandala’s intricate patterns reflect the complexity and richness of a relationship, where each aspect of the union contributes to the overall harmony and balance.
   - **Unity and Diversity**: The mandala also represents the unity of opposites, where diverse elements come together to create a harmonious whole. The Lovers card, through the mandala, suggests that true love involves embracing both the similarities and differences between partners, creating a relationship that is rich, diverse, and complete. The mandala’s circular shape reflects the idea of eternity and the cyclical nature of love, where the relationship evolves and grows over time, always returning to its center.
