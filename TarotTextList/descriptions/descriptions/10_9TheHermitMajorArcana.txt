**The Hermit** is the ninth card in the Major Arcana of the Tarot, representing introspection, solitude, and the pursuit of inner wisdom. The Hermit is a figure who turns away from the external world to seek truth and understanding from within. This card is deeply associated with spiritual enlightenment, self-reflection, and the journey toward inner knowledge. It signifies a time of withdrawal from the noise of the outer world, a period of contemplation, and the quest for deeper meaning and insight.

### Symbolism and Imagery

The imagery of The Hermit is rich with symbolism that conveys its themes of solitude, wisdom, and spiritual seeking. The card typically features a solitary figure, often depicted as an elderly man, standing alone in a desolate landscape. He carries a lantern in one hand and a staff in the other, symbolizing his role as a guide and seeker of truth.

- **The Hermit**: The central figure of the card is The Hermit himself, often depicted as an elderly man with a long beard, wearing a hooded cloak. His age and appearance suggest wisdom, maturity, and the experience that comes from a lifetime of learning. The Hermit represents the seeker who has turned away from the material world to explore the spiritual and intellectual realms. His solitary presence indicates the need for introspection, suggesting that the answers he seeks are not to be found in the external world but within his own soul.

- **The Lantern**: The lantern The Hermit carries is one of the most significant symbols in the card. It represents the light of truth, knowledge, and spiritual enlightenment. The lantern illuminates the path ahead, symbolizing the guidance that comes from inner wisdom and intuition. However, the light from the lantern only reveals a small portion of the path, emphasizing that the journey of self-discovery is one of gradual unfolding, where each step forward reveals more of the truth. The lantern also represents the illumination of the unconscious mind, bringing hidden knowledge to light through introspection and reflection.

- **The Star Within the Lantern**: Inside the lantern is often depicted a six-pointed star, known as the Seal of Solomon, which is a symbol of wisdom and protection. This star further emphasizes the spiritual nature of The Hermit’s quest and his connection to higher knowledge. The six-pointed star represents the union of opposites—such as male and female, or spirit and matter—and the harmony that arises from this union. It suggests that The Hermit’s search for truth is not just intellectual but also spiritual, seeking to integrate and balance the various aspects of his being.

- **The Staff**: The staff The Hermit holds in his other hand symbolizes support, stability, and the journey of life. It represents The Hermit’s ability to stand alone, to rely on his own inner strength and wisdom as he navigates the path of self-discovery. The staff also serves as a reminder that while The Hermit walks a solitary path, he is not without support; his inner guidance and the wisdom he has gained serve as his foundation.

- **The Cloak**: The Hermit’s cloak is a symbol of protection and discretion. It suggests that The Hermit’s journey is an inward one, hidden from the view of others, and that his insights are personal and deeply private. The cloak also represents the need for solitude and the importance of withdrawing from external distractions in order to focus on one’s inner life.

- **The Mountain**: The Hermit is often depicted standing on a mountaintop or in a remote, barren landscape. The mountain symbolizes the heights of spiritual attainment and the isolation that often accompanies the pursuit of higher knowledge. It also represents the challenges and obstacles that must be overcome to reach enlightenment. The desolate landscape emphasizes the theme of solitude and the idea that true wisdom is found not in the noise and activity of the world, but in the stillness of the soul.

- **The Gray Color Scheme**: The Hermit card often features a muted, gray color palette, symbolizing neutrality, introspection, and the absence of distractions. The grayness reflects the inward focus of The Hermit, who is not concerned with the external world’s vibrancy but is instead immersed in contemplation and self-reflection. Gray also suggests the blending of black and white, symbolizing the balance and integration of opposites that The Hermit seeks to achieve.

The Hermit Upright Meaning
The challenge of The Hermit card is to be able to recognize a teacher in a humble disguise. This font of mysterious knowledge will not make it easy for the student to acquire his wisdom, as it takes time and long contemplation to fathom what he knows. He often speaks wordlessly, or in ancient and barbaric tongues, communicating with the elements, animals, and nature herself.
While an hourglass was an identifying feature on the earliest Hermit Tarot cards, more modern cards have shifted the metaphor, showing more or less light released from his lantern. In either case, the Hermit card reminds us of the value of time away from the hubbub of civic life, to relax the ego in communion with nature.

The Hermit Reversed Meaning
When the Hermit card is reversed, you may be resisting the process of evolving towards a level of wisdom that sets you apart. Fear of the path is haunting you; it could be a fear of loneliness.
Try to remember that the shamanic method for facing fears is to relax and open. Let them in and allow them to have their way for a while. This way you know them fully and will see them pass of their own accord. When there are no more surprises, you can move into a place of empowered action.
The Hermit Advice Position
The Hermit advises that you think things through carefully. The demands on you have been high, giving you scant time for reflection. While you have a gift for understanding the larger implications involved, you need some private time to consider the steps to take in the future. You can't just lock yourself in your room for fifteen minutes and expect to come up with profound solutions. You need more seclusion and time to assimilate and process.
Now may be the moment for you to tell everyone to leave you alone. When you are fully ready, you will be able and willing to give others what they need.
The Hermit Love Position
The Hermit in this position describes an individual who has a relationship with the spirit world instead of society. The Hermit prefers to specialize in what is esoteric. He studies the inner sciences -- yoga, tantra, self-cultivation. The Hermit is involved with consciousness development that takes him beyond the limited human ego and puts him in touch with the vastness of cosmic creation. He or she may have very little time for ordinary human commerce, relationship complexities, and its various distractions.
This card points to inner study. It's about immersing yourself in the mysteries of natural law. The Hermit looks like an old man but in reality he is an eternal child full of wonder, gazing into the mysteries of the inner life.
The Hermit Career Position
When the Hermit is in this position, you crave plenty of privacy and an end to the stimulation coming from work. Make the usual supervisors, critics, and back seat drivers disappear for a while if you can. Then you can study the situation without the interference of other people's personalities and agendas. This is a wonderful opportunity for contemplation. It is possible in a situation like this that you will experience some precognition and sense of what is to come.
Your need for inner stillness is strong. Do your best to cultivate it. Otherwise, you may find it difficult to be patient with the day-to-day chatter and bustle that is the norm when you're on the job. Try to have as little human interaction as possible until you get the message that inner voices are trying to communicate to you.

The Hermit in a Yes or No Card Reading

To hear it, he must disconnect from the crowds whose voices and desires threaten to overcome his own. He walks through the dark night of his unconscious, guided only by the low light of the northern star, with his destination being his home, his self.

Upright Love Meaning

pause in love life to introspect, self-understanding in love

Upright Hermit Tarot Love Meaning
Love, being one of life’s greatest mysteries, can be a great teacher. It requires all of us to truly know ourselves, our needs, our fears and our insecurities. The Hermit tarot love meaning can signal that we may need some time alone in order to develop some insight about our selves before forming a strong romantic relationship with another person. This period may feel a bit lonely, but it will place you on the right path to finding a love that you are meant to have. If you’re already in a relationship, this soul-searching is something that the two of you may want to do together. Both of you may want to think about what you expect out of a relationship, and what may make you happier. The initial talks may be uncomfortable, but will prepare a strong foundation for tackling the future ahead.

Upright Career Meaning

contemplating next steps in career, searching for purpose in career

Career Meaning - Upright Hermit
You may be spending some much needed time thinking about what you want out of your career right now. You may feel as though the path you are treading at the moment is not really working for you, and there can be the sense of not being fulfilled. Right now, you are trying to understand what kind of work would give you joy on all levels. If you’ve been pursuing a career purely for money, or financial stability, these qualifications are no longer enough for you. You may be looking for a purpose, or at least something that gets you closer to who you want to be.

Upright Finances Meaning

contemplating role of finances in happiness, less focus on material things
  
Finances Meaning - Upright Hermit
You may be coming to the realization that money doesn’t bring you happiness right now. This may be a time with less focus on material things, and more focus on trying to understand where you can truly find fulfillment. 

Reversed Hermit Meaning
When reversed, you are perhaps in a situation where you'd like to be alone; there is nothing wrong about that. However, there is a possibility that your seclusion may become harmful to both yourself and others. Though the Hermit sets forwards with noble intentions to search for his inner truth, his path inward may also be filled with great danger. Going inward may lead to madness and the abyss, for the unconscious is filled with images that he may not yet understand, lurking and waiting to lure you ever inside. Like a man that gets lost in his own dreams, the hermit may find himself stuck in a world of his own, alone, trapped, unreal. You must learn to balance your need for truth with connection to your fellow human.
When it comes to work, the hermit reversal meaning refers to your preparedness to get to the bottom of something that has been troubling you for quite some time now. There is searching to be done, and it will be your responsibility to ask the question that will allow the other people to understand the circumstances.

Reversed Love Meaning

romantic rejection, loneliness, feeling distant from partner

Reversed Hermit Tarot Love Meaning
The reversed Hermit tarot love meaning can indicate a period of loneliness, one that is being forced on you instead of one that you are initiating yourself. While this time may be trying, making the most of it can help you concentrate on your own goals, and clarify what it is you want from a partner and from life. These will be the building blocks for creating a strong future relationship. Should you already be in a relationship, you may find that one of you feels distant and is drifting away. Someone may feel alone in the partnership, despite each person’s efforts. Now is the time to examine these dynamics and see whether you can extend a hand. Attention, care and a strong dose of self-awareness may be needed in order to feel connected again.

You may now need to do a bit of realignment, whether it’s looking for a new job, networking to find mentors and teammates, or other more socially related aspects of developing your career. On the other hand, it can also be that your period of solitude can be extending further; you may choose to avoid working with others altogether. Being on your own may feel much less limiting at first; but make sure you continue to receive social support. At times, this card can also indicate being forced to work alone, leading to feelings of loneliness, or being an outcast amongst your coworkers. 

Reversed Finances Meaning

better understanding of material situation

The Hermit, the ninth card in the Tarot's Major Arcana, represents introspection, wisdom, solitude, and the quest for inner knowledge. The Hermit is often depicted as an elderly figure holding a lantern, symbolizing the search for truth and enlightenment. Through the lens of Sacred Geometry, The Hermit’s symbolism is deeply intertwined with the concepts of inner balance, spiritual insight, and the journey toward self-realization. Here’s a detailed exploration of how Sacred Geometry applies to The Hermit:

### 1. **The Number 9 (Symbol of Completion, Wisdom, and Spiritual Enlightenment)**
   - **The Enneagram (Nine-Pointed Star)**: The number 9 is associated with the enneagram, a nine-pointed geometric figure that represents the completion of a cycle, wisdom, and spiritual insight. The enneagram’s structure reflects the complexity of human consciousness, with each point representing a different aspect of the self or stage in the journey toward enlightenment. The Hermit, as the ninth card, embodies this wisdom and completion, symbolizing the final stages of the spiritual journey where deeper truths are realized. The enneagram’s interlocking lines suggest the interconnectedness of different aspects of the self, and The Hermit’s role is to illuminate these connections, helping to integrate them into a cohesive understanding.
   - **Nine as the Symbol of the Initiate**: In numerology, the number 9 is often seen as the number of the initiate or the spiritual seeker. It represents the end of a cycle and the attainment of spiritual knowledge. The Hermit’s journey is one of deep introspection and solitude, where the seeker withdraws from the external world to find inner illumination. The number 9’s association with completion and fulfillment reflects The Hermit’s role as a guide who has attained a level of mastery and now seeks to illuminate the path for others.

### 2. **The Vesica Piscis (Symbol of Duality, Creation, and Enlightenment)**
   - **The Light of Illumination**: The Vesica Piscis, formed by the intersection of two circles, represents the point of balance and union between dualities. In the context of The Hermit, this symbol can be interpreted as the lantern he carries, which illuminates the darkness and symbolizes the enlightenment that comes from balancing and integrating the dual aspects of the self—conscious and unconscious, material and spiritual. The Vesica Piscis, as the symbol of the divine feminine and the gateway to higher knowledge, emphasizes The Hermit’s role as a seeker of truth who ventures into the unknown to bring back wisdom and insight.
   - **Gateway to Higher Knowledge**: The Vesica Piscis also represents a doorway or portal through which new understanding and awareness can emerge. The Hermit’s lantern, which guides the way through darkness, symbolizes this gateway to higher knowledge. The Hermit stands at the threshold, between the known and the unknown, ready to cross into the realms of deeper wisdom. The Vesica Piscis underscores the idea that enlightenment is achieved by navigating this liminal space, where the seeker must reconcile and integrate the dualities within themselves.

### 3. **The Circle (Symbol of Wholeness, Unity, and the Self)**
   - **The Hermit as the Center of the Circle**: The circle, representing unity, wholeness, and the eternal, is a powerful symbol of The Hermit’s journey. The Hermit stands at the center of this circle, symbolizing his position as a point of stillness and reflection within the vastness of the cosmos. The circle’s unbroken line represents the completeness of The Hermit’s understanding and the infinite nature of his quest for knowledge. In this context, The Hermit’s lantern can be seen as the illumination of the center, the light of consciousness that shines within the circle of the self, revealing the deeper truths that lie within.
   - **The Inner Sanctum**: The circle also symbolizes the inner sanctum of the self, a space of solitude and introspection where The Hermit withdraws to seek enlightenment. The Hermit’s journey is not outward but inward, toward the center of the circle where the essence of truth resides. The circle’s symbolism of wholeness and unity reflects The Hermit’s role in guiding others to find this center within themselves, helping them to achieve a sense of completeness and self-realization.

### 4. **The Spiral (Symbol of Growth, Evolution, and the Journey Inward)**
   - **The Inward Spiral of Wisdom**: The spiral, a fundamental symbol in Sacred Geometry, represents growth, evolution, and the journey toward the center. For The Hermit, the spiral symbolizes the inward journey of introspection and self-discovery. As The Hermit moves deeper into the spiral, he uncovers layers of wisdom and understanding, each turn bringing him closer to the core of his being. The spiral’s connection to cycles and repetition reflects the idea that The Hermit’s path is one of continual growth and deepening insight, where each experience builds upon the last, leading to greater spiritual awareness.
   - **Continuous Refinement**: The spiral also symbolizes the continuous refinement of the self, where The Hermit’s journey is one of peeling away the outer layers of illusion to reveal the truth at the core. The spiral’s inward movement mirrors The Hermit’s introspective journey, where the focus is on understanding the self at deeper and deeper levels. This process of refinement and evolution is central to The Hermit’s role as a seeker of truth, where each step along the spiral path brings him closer to enlightenment.

### 5. **The Triangle (Symbol of Integration and Ascension)**
   - **Integration of Mind, Body, and Spirit**: The triangle, with its three sides, is a symbol of trinity, integration, and ascension. In the context of The Hermit, the triangle represents the integration of mind, body, and spirit, which is essential for attaining wisdom and self-realization. The Hermit’s journey involves the harmonization of these three aspects of the self, where the physical body, mental faculties, and spiritual essence are brought into alignment. The upward-pointing triangle also symbolizes the process of ascension, where The Hermit’s introspective journey leads to a higher state of consciousness and spiritual awareness.
   - **Pyramid of Wisdom**: The triangle, especially when considered as a pyramid, represents the stable foundation upon which spiritual knowledge is built. The Hermit’s lantern can be seen as the light at the apex of this pyramid, symbolizing the illumination that comes from a solid understanding of the self and the world. The triangle’s stability reflects The Hermit’s role as a guide who stands on a firm foundation of knowledge, ready to share his wisdom with those who seek it.

### 6. **The Hexagon and Hexagram (Symbol of Balance, Structure, and Harmony)**
   - **Hexagon as a Symbol of Inner Balance**: The hexagon, with its six sides, represents balance, harmony, and the efficient structuring of energy. In the context of The Hermit, the hexagon symbolizes the inner balance that is achieved through solitude and introspection. The Hermit’s journey is one of finding harmony within oneself, where each aspect of the self is recognized and integrated into a cohesive whole. The hexagon’s connection to natural structures, such as in honeycombs, reflects the idea that The Hermit’s wisdom is grounded in the natural order and the inherent balance of the universe.
   - **Hexagram (Star of David)**: The hexagram, or Star of David, is formed by the interlocking of two equilateral triangles, symbolizing the union of opposites—spirit and matter, masculine and feminine, conscious and unconscious. The Hermit embodies this union, where his journey involves the reconciliation and integration of these dualities. The hexagram’s perfect symmetry reflects The Hermit’s quest for harmony and balance, where true wisdom arises from the integration of all aspects of the self.

### 7. **The Flower of Life (Symbol of Interconnection and the Blueprint of Existence)**
   - **The Hermit as the Seeker of Universal Truths**: The Flower of Life, a complex geometric pattern composed of overlapping circles, symbolizes the interconnectedness of all life and the underlying structure of the universe. The Hermit’s journey is one of seeking to understand these universal truths, where his lantern represents the light of consciousness that illuminates the intricate patterns of existence. The Flower of Life’s symbolism of interconnection reflects The Hermit’s awareness that all things are connected, and that true wisdom involves seeing the unity within diversity.
   - **Blueprint of Spiritual Growth**: The Flower of Life also represents the blueprint of spiritual growth, where each circle symbolizes a different stage or aspect of the journey. The Hermit’s role is to guide others along this path, helping them to recognize and understand the patterns that govern their lives. The Flower of Life’s intricate design emphasizes the complexity and depth of the knowledge that The Hermit seeks, where each layer of understanding builds upon the last, leading to a more comprehensive awareness of the self and the universe.

### 8. **The Cube (Symbol of Stability and Foundation in Knowledge)**
   - **Foundation of Inner Knowledge**: The cube, a symbol of stability, structure, and the material world, represents the solid foundation upon which The Hermit builds his knowledge. The Hermit’s journey is one of grounding his insights and wisdom in a stable and well-structured understanding of the self and the world. The cube’s six faces also symbolize the idea that The Hermit’s knowledge is multifaceted, requiring balance and harmony in all areas of life. The cube’s symbolism of structure and order reflects The Hermit’s role in organizing and systematizing his knowledge, ensuring that it is both practical and profound.
   - **Earth Element and Practical Wisdom**: The cube is associated with the element of earth, symbolizing practicality, physicality, and the material aspects of life. In The Hermit’s journey, the cube’s connection to the earth element emphasizes the importance of grounding spiritual insights in practical application. The Hermit’s wisdom is not just theoretical but deeply connected to the realities of everyday life, where his insights can be applied to help others navigate their own journeys. The cube’s symbolism of structure and stability reflects the idea that true wisdom is both profound and practical, offering guidance that is both spiritual and grounded in the material world.

### 9. **The Mandala (Symbol of Wholeness, Unity, and the Inner Journey)**
   - **Mandala of Inner Wisdom**: The mandala, a complex geometric design that represents the universe and cosmic order, is a symbol of wholeness, unity, and the journey inward. In The Hermit’s journey, the mandala represents the inner landscape that he explores, where each layer of the mandala symbolizes a different aspect of the self or a stage in the journey toward enlightenment. The mandala’s intricate patterns reflect the complexity of the inner world, where true wisdom is achieved through the harmonious integration of all aspects of the self. The Hermit’s lantern, which illuminates the path, symbolizes the light of consciousness that guides the way through the mandala’s labyrinthine paths.
   - **Centering and Integration**: The mandala’s central point represents the core of the self, where all aspects of the individual are unified and brought into balance. The Hermit’s journey is one of moving toward this center, where true enlightenment is found. The mandala’s circular shape emphasizes the idea that the journey is not linear but cyclical, where each turn of the path brings the seeker closer to the center of their being. The Hermit’s role is to guide others on this journey, helping them to find their own center and achieve a sense of wholeness and unity within themselves.

### 10. **The Merkaba (Symbol of Divine Light and Ascension)**
   - **The Hermit as a Guide of Ascension**: The Merkaba, a star tetrahedron, is a powerful symbol of divine light, ascension, and the integration of the spiritual and physical realms. The Hermit’s lantern can be seen as a representation of the Merkaba, symbolizing the light of divine wisdom that illuminates the path of spiritual ascension. The Hermit’s journey is one of guiding others toward higher states of consciousness, where the integration of the spiritual and material aspects of the self leads to enlightenment. The Merkaba’s structure, with its interconnected tetrahedrons, reflects the idea that The Hermit’s wisdom is both multidimensional and interconnected, encompassing both the spiritual and physical realms.
   - **Protection and Guidance**: The Merkaba is also associated with divine protection and guidance, ensuring that the seeker is safeguarded on their journey toward enlightenment. The Hermit’s lantern represents this divine light, which guides the way through the darkness and ensures that the seeker remains on the path of truth. The Merkaba’s connection to ascension reflects The Hermit’s role in helping others rise above the limitations of the material world and achieve a higher state of being, where they can access the divine wisdom that lies within.

The Hermit, through the lens of Sacred Geometry, is revealed as a profound symbol of inner wisdom, spiritual enlightenment, and the journey toward self-realization. The card is deeply connected to geometric principles such as the enneagram, Vesica Piscis, circle, spiral, triangle, hexagon, Flower of Life, cube, mandala, and Merkaba. Each of these symbols reflects aspects of The Hermit’s journey—how he seeks to understand the interconnectedness of all things, how he navigates the inner landscape of the self, and how he serves as a guide for others on their path toward enlightenment. Sacred Geometry reveals The Hermit not just as a solitary seeker of truth but as a master of the inner realms, who illuminates the way for others to find their own path to wisdom and self-realization, guided by the underlying patterns and structures that govern the universe.
