**Justice** is the eleventh card in the Major Arcana of the Tarot, symbolizing fairness, truth, balance, and the moral principles that govern our actions. This card represents the natural law of cause and effect, the idea that our actions have consequences, and the importance of making decisions that are just and equitable. When Justice appears in a reading, it often signals a time of judgment, where decisions need to be made with integrity, and the outcome will reflect the fairness of those choices.

### Symbolism and Imagery

The Justice card is rich in symbolism, each element carefully chosen to represent the themes of balance, fairness, and moral rectitude.

- **The Figure of Justice**: At the center of the card is a figure, typically depicted as a woman, representing the personification of Justice. She often sits on a throne, dressed in red or white robes, symbolizing both passion and purity. Justice's expression is usually serene and composed, reflecting the impartiality and calmness required to make fair decisions. Her position on the throne signifies her authority and the power she holds to administer justice.

- **The Scales**: In her left hand, Justice holds a set of scales, perfectly balanced. The scales are a universal symbol of balance and fairness, representing the weighing of evidence, the consideration of all sides of an argument, and the need to evaluate situations with an impartial mind. The scales also symbolize the balance between different aspects of life, such as intellect and emotion, or the material and spiritual realms. They remind us that true justice involves considering all factors and ensuring that the outcome is balanced and fair.

- **The Sword**: In her right hand, Justice holds a double-edged sword, raised upright. The sword represents the power of reason, truth, and the ability to cut through deception and falsehoods. The double-edged nature of the sword emphasizes that justice can be both protective and punitive—while it defends truth and fairness, it can also deliver punishment to those who act unjustly. The sword's upright position signifies that justice is swift and decisive, and that it must be executed with clarity and precision.

- **The Crown**: Justice is often depicted wearing a crown, symbolizing her authority and the wisdom required to administer justice. The crown may be adorned with jewels or other symbols of power, emphasizing that justice is not just an abstract concept but a force that governs the actions of rulers and leaders. The crown also represents the connection between justice and divine or higher laws, suggesting that true justice is aligned with universal principles.

- **The Pillars**: Justice is frequently shown seated between two pillars, similar to those seen in the High Priestess card. These pillars represent duality, law, and order, and they serve as a reminder that justice must be balanced between opposing forces, such as mercy and severity, or compassion and punishment. The pillars also suggest that justice is a fundamental principle that upholds society, providing structure and stability.

- **The Cloak and Robes**: Justice is usually depicted wearing a cloak or robes that are often red, symbolizing passion, or white, symbolizing purity and the impartial nature of justice. The robes may also include other symbolic details, such as a square pattern or other geometric shapes, emphasizing the structured and orderly nature of justice. The robes signify the protection and authority that come with the role of administering justice.

- **The Throne**: Justice is seated on a throne, symbolizing her position of power and authority. The throne itself may be adorned with symbols of law, order, and truth, further emphasizing the connection between justice and the principles that govern society. The throne represents the stability and permanence of justice, as well as the idea that justice is a guiding force that must be upheld at all times.

- **The Background**: The background of the Justice card is often simple and uncluttered, emphasizing the clarity and straightforwardness of justice. There may be a suggestion of a courtroom or a temple, reinforcing the association with legal and moral judgment. The background may also include other symbolic elements, such as the scales of justice or a book of laws, emphasizing the importance of truth and fairness in all decisions.

Adjustment Upright Meaning
The Justice Tarot card has to do with moral sensitivity and that which gives rise to empathy, compassion, and a sense of fairness. Since the time of Solomon, this image has represented a standard for the humane and fair-minded treatment of other beings.
Often including the image of a fulcrum or scale which helps to balance competing needs against the greater good, and a two-edged sword to symbolize the precision needed to make clear judgments, this card reminds us to be careful to attend to important details. It's a mistake to overlook or minimize anything where this card is concerned. The law of karma is represented here -- what goes around comes around.
Adjustment Reversed Meaning
When the Justice card is reversed, the deeper meaning of this situation is being withheld for reasons only Higher Power truly understands. There are times that logical, common, rational and organic laws are overridden by some paradoxical higher order.
At such times you won't be fully informed about what is going on. Wait, stay quiet, keep watching and listening. Eventually the chaos will resolve itself and the truth will be revealed.
Adjustment Advice Position
The Justice card advises you to listen carefully as others explain to you their version of events and the parts they played. It is unnecessary to offer feedback. Your role is to observe, listen closely, give a full hearing and keep your wits about you as the story takes shape.
As you witness people's account of themselves, your understanding will go beyond the words you hear. Subtle inferences and clues will reveal the truths that will enable you to make a wise and accurate assessment.
Adjustment Love Position
The Justice card asks you to distinguish between desire and need. Justice carries the scales and sword of legal probity, but in her heart she is attempting to understand what is behind the conflict so she can meet the needs on both sides.
Justice is not always meted equally across the board, however. Sometimes one side must be treated differently than the other. The fundamental concept behind your forthcoming relationship is the greatest good for the greatest number.
Adjustment Career Position
When Justice is in this position, you could be facing some sort of judgment. There may be no way to enter a plea or counter motion. Your deeds, thoughts and words are on display. The truth is to be disclosed before all. Compassion is factored in only after full accountability has been determined. Hopefully you have lived up to a high standard and maintained your ethics and ideals. Any attempts to dissemble or skew the issues or arguments are likely to be counted against you.
What strategy to take? Do your best to listen, learn, understand and discipline yourself. Examine your motives, remaining scrupulously objective. Realize that you can get some benefit from this experience.

Adjustment in a Yes or No Card Reading
Justice is a card of clarity and honor. If you're looking for simple Yes or No guidance and receive Justice, the answer is NO. Wait until all the facts are known before taking action

Justice, the eleventh card in the Tarot's Major Arcana, embodies the principles of balance, fairness, truth, and moral integrity. It is a card that represents the universal law of cause and effect, where actions have consequences and fairness prevails. When analyzed through the lens of Sacred Geometry, the symbolism of Justice deepens, revealing connections to the universal laws that govern balance, harmony, and the structure of reality. Here’s a detailed exploration of how Sacred Geometry applies to the Justice card:

### 1. **The Number 11 (Symbol of Duality, Balance, and Mastery)**
   - **The Symbolism of 11**: The number 11 is a master number in numerology, representing a higher level of spiritual insight, intuition, and enlightenment. It is often associated with duality (1 and 1), balance, and the integration of opposites. In the context of the Justice card, the number 11 reflects the delicate balance between opposing forces—right and wrong, action and consequence, light and dark. The number also symbolizes the pillars of law and order, standing as twin forces that maintain equilibrium in the universe. Justice, as card 11, highlights the importance of maintaining balance and harmony in all aspects of life, guided by a higher moral understanding.

The symmetry and balance of these pillars underscore the principle that true justice is impartial and steadfast, grounded in universal laws that transcend personal bias.

### 2. **The Vesica Piscis (Symbol of Balance, Intersection, and Justice)**
   - **Intersection of Dualities**: The Vesica Piscis, formed by the intersection of two circles, is a powerful symbol in Sacred Geometry that represents the balance and union of dualities. In the context of the Justice card, the Vesica Piscis can be seen as the intersection where truth and fairness meet. It symbolizes the balanced judgment that arises when both sides of a situation are considered equally, and justice is dispensed impartially. The Vesica Piscis also represents the idea that justice is found at the point where opposing forces come together and are harmonized.
   - **The Eye of Justice**: The Vesica Piscis is sometimes referred to as the "Eye of God" or the "Eye of Wisdom," representing insight and clarity. In the Justice card, this symbolism reflects the idea that true justice requires clear vision and the ability to see beyond surface appearances to the underlying truth. The Vesica Piscis, as the eye of Justice, emphasizes the importance of wisdom and discernment in making fair and balanced decisions.

### 3. **The Equilateral Triangle (Symbol of Balance, Equality, and Truth)**
   - **The Triangle of Justice**: The equilateral triangle, with its three equal sides, is a symbol of balance, equality, and harmony. In the context of the Justice card, the triangle represents the balance between mind, body, and spirit, as well as the balance between the past, present, and future. The triangle’s perfect symmetry reflects the ideal of justice, where all sides are equal, and every action is weighed carefully to ensure fairness. The triangle also symbolizes the threefold law of cause and effect, where actions in one area of life affect the other two, and where balance must be maintained for justice to prevail.
   - **The Pyramid of Truth**: The triangle can also be viewed as a pyramid, representing the ascent to higher truth and understanding. In Justice, the pyramid symbolizes the elevation of human consciousness to a level where justice is not just a legal concept but a spiritual principle that guides all actions.

The square’s connection to the material world emphasizes that justice must be applied consistently and fairly in all aspects of life, ensuring that the balance of the physical world is maintained.

### 5. **The Circle (Symbol of Wholeness, Unity, and Cosmic Law)**
   - **Justice as Cosmic Law**: The circle, representing unity, wholeness, and eternity, is a symbol of the universal laws that govern the cosmos.

### 6. **The Golden Ratio (Symbol of Divine Proportion, Balance, and Harmony)**
